Uganda has plans to construct a US $309m airport in the oil-drilling region near Hoima and Lake Albert in north-western Uganda. Shikun & Binui’s international construction arm SBI will build the airport, which is expected to support the region’s oil industry. “The selection of Shikun & Binui to carry out this project confirms, once again, the superb reputation that SBI enjoys in Africa. A reputation based on its proven operational capabilities, its deep understanding of the local work environment, and its commitment to comply with the most stringent international standards,” said Shikun & Binui chairman Moshe Lahmani. The project includes the construction of 3.5km of runways, a cargo terminal, and an air traffic control tower, along with other residential and service structures.
