Bobcat has unveiled the latest version of its largest compact excavator, the 8.5-ton E85, which is part of the companyâ€™s R-Series lineup. Its 66-horsepower Bobcat turbo-charged diesel engine does not require a diesel particulate filter or selective catalytic reduction. It is designed to work in tight spaces with 13 inches of tail overhang, and the boom frame stays within the width of the tracks as it swings. Bobcat also added a standard lift eye to help operators lift and place objects. An optional depth-check system allows the operator to measure depth and grade, within a half-inch of accuracy, without exiting the excavator. The system minimizes over- or under-digging, and it does not require a separate display screen, the company says. The new E85 boasts a bucket digging force of 16,269 lb.-ft., a 12 percent improvement over the previous generation machine. Arm digging force is 8,253 lb.-ft. and lift capacity is 9,754 pounds. The cab has been redesigned with more floor space. Travel pedals fold away. The top window, narrower side pillars, left and right mirrors and new sun visor are designed to improve visibility. A new tubular-frame reinforced cab door is designed to keep out dust and dirt, and the cab is rate at Level 1 falling object protection. Automatic heating and air conditioning and a heated seat are optional. An easy-to-reach control pattern selector is standard. Operators can quickly switch from ISO controls to standard controls and toggle between an optional second auxiliary hydraulic switch and the boom offset from the left joystick. Bobcat says the excavator provides easy access to the engine for maintenance, and the company strengthened hinges and latches and added rigid, aligned panels to reduce cab vibration. Greasing intervals have been extended to 50 hours for the swing and slew and to 250 hours on upper work-group pivot points, the company says. The E85 offers a variety of options: The following Bobcat attachments can be operated with the E85:
