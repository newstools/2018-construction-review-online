Max is optimistic that GE’s goodwill visit would culminate in investment opportunities. “We want to engage in the Batoka Power Plant, which is a game-changer for Zimbabwe. We also want to install mini hydro-power stations because Zimbabwe is blessed with a large density of dams,” he added. The proposed US $1.6bn station will generate 1,600MW of hydropower from the Zambezi river which runs between Zimbabwe and Zambia. Max further highlighted that GE had previously supplied turbines and generators and played a key role in the rehabilitation and refurbishment of the Kariba South power station. It has also worked at Hwange Power Station in close partnership with power utility Zesa Holdings.
