As a Civil Engineer himself, Minister Fouda instructed the construction company to add personnel, engage a non-stop working scheme and drill a bore-hole for sufficient water supply. The Minister explained that the Buea Referral Hospital will be useful during the up-coming 2019 Africa Cup of Nations billed for Cameroon. Though construction has delayed, the enterprise has promised to mobilize more intensively and to employ 250 workers to double their staff-strength and improve on work pace. The whole project including the referral hospital costs a whopping US $280m and out of it, US $56m is for two General hospitals and US$ 22m for eight Hospital centres in eight Regions of Cameroon. This gives an average of US $28m per project.
