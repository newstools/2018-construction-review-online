The Federal Government of Nigeria is currently seeking a loan of about US $40bn to US $46bn to complete some ongoing rail projects and embark on new ones. This is according to Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi. “I think the rail sector is doing fine. The first aspect of it , which is the narrow gauge is where we are not doing much. We are not doing much in the sense that we are negotiating with General Electric, GE to renovate the narrow gauge and manage it under concession,” he said. The concession will see GE invest in the narrow gauge rail system that traverses almost the entire country.
