The meeting was held on Tuesday in Casablanca on the sides-lines of the on-going Africa Nations Championship (CHAN 2018) in Morocco. “Coter Terhrazaz Construction will begin construction works of both stadiums in Gicumbi and Rusizi, in April. Based on the meeting we had, they will use these two months to ship their equipment to Rwanda,” he said. “They have accessed the topographical requirements of each site and are ready to begin works without any issues,” added Nzamwita. Coter Terhrazaz Construction Company has so far constructed 63 artificial stadiums and five natural grass stadiums in Morocco. Last year, the Federation Royal Marocaine de Football under the FERWAFA-FRMF pact agreed to finance the construction of artificial turf stadiums in various districts in Rwanda plus renovate the existing stadiums. The partnership includes exchange programmes of technical and administrative staff, hosting of national and club teams from the country, training camps, sharing football knowledge, and offering extensive and advanced medical treatment to injured national team players.
