A mega US $9m private hospital is set to be constructed in Nairobi’s Muthaiga North area after the residents endorsed the initiative. The project which is located off Kiambu Road will be a 100-bed private hospital with a fully equipped gym, a therapy pool and an aerobics centre and this will improve the area’s value as an investment destination. The residents’ association of the affluent neighborhood filed a no-objection notice saying the new medical facility by the Kiambu Road Investment Ltd (KRIL) will ease hours spent by motorists racing through Nairobi’s traffic to ferry patients to Upperhill-based Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi Hospital as well as private hospitals in Parklands.
