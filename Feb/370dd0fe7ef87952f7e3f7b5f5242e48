The Federal Executive Council (FEC) of Nigeria has completed the design for the reconstruction of a major part of Apapa-Oworonshoki expressway in Lagos meant to be concessioned to Dangote Group and consequently handed it to the company. The council has also approved the augmentation of the contract cost for the construction of trailer and truck park on Tin Can Island in Lagos from the initial US $24.3m to US $26.7m. Addressing the State House correspondents during the weekly FEC meeting in the State House, Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, said the truck park project which is part of the move to ease acute traffic crisis along the collapsed Oshodi-Apapa express way, will be completed this year. The minister also presented one memorandum seeking the augmentation of the price due to the need for increased scope of work especially shoreline protection of the Tin Can Trailer and Truck Pack, which is almost finished. “It is an ongoing project. We sought the council’s approval to augment the price. We expect that the truck pack will now be completed this year and it will be one of the many multi-prong efforts being pursued to give relief to the Apapa area, to facilitate vehicular truck and trailer movement and also maritime and import and export business and general economic activity for Apapa in particular, Lagos at large and the country as a whole. The memorandum was approved,” said Fashola.
