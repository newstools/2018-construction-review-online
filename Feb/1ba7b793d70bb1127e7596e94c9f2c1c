The Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) has lauded Nigeria’s president Muhammadu Buhari’s executive order on local content as a move in the right direction which would drastically reduce capital flight in the country. According NSE President Mr. Kunle Makuolu the order will boost the capacity of local engineers to contribute their quota to the development of Nigeria. The order, labeled “Executive Order 5’’, is meant to improve local content in public procurement with science, engineering and technology components. Moreover, it also prohibits the ministry of interior from giving visas to foreign workers whose skills are readily available in Nigeria.

Mr. Makuolu further urged the president to ensure that the order is obeyed to prevent Nigerians from continuously developing other economies and neglecting their own. “I can only prove myself and get experience in this country and the time will come when those people who are not competent will leave. When you get your nationals to execute projects, you are only doing yourself a favour because whatever benefits foreigners bring would be wiped out later,” he said. “If you get a foreigner to execute projects when you are buoyant, he would not remember your commitment when you are broke, that is why government must engage its nationals and encourage in-house capacity,” he added.
