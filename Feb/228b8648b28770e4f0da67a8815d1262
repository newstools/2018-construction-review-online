Future Energy East Africa has evolved from the East African Power Industry Convention (EAPIC). After years of close collaboration with utilities, governments, regulators, large power users, consultants and solution providers it has become the number one power conference and exhibition in East Africa and will take place from 12–13 September 2018 in Nairobi, Kenya. Over 45 suppliers from across the world will not only exhibit their latest technology and solutions but will be waiting to share their experience, case studies and best practices with you. Future Energy East Africa – celebrating 20 years in East Africa is the largest and longest running regional power conference and exhibition in East Africa, making it a well-known and trusted brand. The event boasts both a strategic conference and a large trade exhibition which provides a platform for public and private stakeholders to engage in discussions around the future of the East African energy sector, giving stakeholders the opportunity to benchmark their operations, challenges and achievements against their peers and seek suppliers who are looking to gain access to projects across the region. 12 – 13 September 2018 KICC, Nairobi, Kenya www.future-energy-eastafrica.com
