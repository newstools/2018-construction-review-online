The concerned water basin agencies have also given a green light, taking into account the quality of the projects presented by Voltalia. The electricity will be sold under long-term private Power Purchase Agreements, which are currently under negotiation with corporate clients. “They confirm Voltalia’s capacity to position itself as a first class partner for the electricity provision of its clients, at a competitive price,” adds Yoni Ammar, CEO of Voltalia Morocco. Last month, another French company, VINCI Construction, was awarded a US $346m  contract to build a pumped storage hydroelectric plant, near Agadir. These hydropower projects form part of Morocco’s ambitious objective aiming to source 52% of its installed capacity from renewable energy by 2030. The North African country has an increasing energy consumption of roughly 6% per year and an energy dependence rate of around 95%.
