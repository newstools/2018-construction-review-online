Construction of the US $37m Gidabo Irrigation Dam in Ethiopia is almost complete and will begin operations in the next few months. It is set to irrigate 27,043ha of land once complete. The mega dam has a capacity to hold 63 million cubic metres of water and stands 21.2m tall “Its initial completion was expected within two years of construction, beginning 2010 but the completion period was modified after the need to redesign the Dam to fully utilize Gidabo river’s potential as well as increase the Dam’s capacity,” according to Abdulfetah Taju, project manager of the Dam.
