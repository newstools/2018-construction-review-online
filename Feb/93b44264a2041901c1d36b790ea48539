Speaking at a consumer dialogue forum at Royal Court Hotel, Mombasa, he directed the firm to resolve all the queries. Mr Oimeke also said the ERC had identified a way to address the high cost of electricity, which he attributed to ‘system losses’; movement of power from one point to another. He said the glitch did not affect industrial consumers or those on tokens but the ones using the old type of meters. He also advised those who were overcharged during the system upgrade to report to Kenya Power for redress.
