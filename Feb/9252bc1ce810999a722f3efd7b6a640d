Construction work on the four roads linking Garissa highway to Thika bypass has commenced. The US $14.9m project will include tarmacking of the first 2.1km stretch from Engen to Kiganjo junction. According to H Young, the contractor for the 2.1km stretch class D road, the road’s two lanes and carriageway shoulders will be completed in a week. “We guarantee that the tarmac laid will last more than 20 years,” said site agent Engineer Earnest Ruto. Afterwards, the contractor will embark on Broadway-Athena link road, BAT-Kiganjo link road and Kivulini-Kiganjo link road. Speaking while commissioning the construction of the first link road, Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina said that once completed, the bypass will ease traffic getting into Thika town and its environs by offering alternative routes. It is expected that once completed, motorists driving towards Nairobi from Garissa and those coming from Nyeri, Meru and Murang’a heading towards Garissa will not need to pass through the town. “This will help ease traffic along Garissa road and open up Kiganjo, Kiang’ombe, Kiandutu and Athena to investors.

Thika West deputy county commissioner Tom Anjere called on investors to take advantage of the ongoing road expansion works to set up affordable residential apartments to help meet the government’s housing agenda.
