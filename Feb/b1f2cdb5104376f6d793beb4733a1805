The Gauteng Department for Roads and Transport officially has officially opened the upgraded Cedar Road in Fourways, South Africa. According to MEC for Roads and Transport, Ismail Vadi, the road department has yet reached another milestone in providing world-class road infrastructure. MEC Vadi was speaking at the opening of the upgraded Cedar Road in Johannesburg on Tuesday, Jan, 30th 2018 . The US $7.3m project is a public-private partnership (PPP) between the Gauteng Roads and Transport Department and Steyn City Development. “This is in line with the provincial government’s commitment to working closely with the private sector in improving and delivering on essential transport infrastructure in the province,” MEC Vadi said The provincial department said in recent years, the Gauteng government’s partnership with the private sector and the City of Johannesburg has resulted in more than US $547m injection into the Steyn City development, which includes the construction of a new arterial road (R511) and infrastructure for basic services. MEC Vadi said that Cedar Road is an “inter-urban collector of traffic” for surrounding townships and experiences a mix of light and heavy traffic from the northern outskirts of Johannesburg. “The department maintains that investment in road infrastructure serves as a key stimulator of economic growth. It creates jobs and promotes social development. “Chief amongst the greater economic benefits for this region are the development opportunities this upgrading will generate. Previously unattractive land tracts next to the road now look ready for development,” he added.
