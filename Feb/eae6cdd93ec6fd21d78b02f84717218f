Future Energy Nigeria has evolved from the West African Power Industry Convention (WAPIC). This energy conference and expo addressing the Nigerian power crisis through industry connectivity and creative solutions. After 15 years of successfully driving new and existing industry relationships across the region, WAPIC has established its base in Nigeria to support the privatisation of the Nigerian power space. A country going through a tough economic cycle, compounded by a struggling energy sector, it is now that the platform of a meeting place to engage industry stakeholders keen to represent the sector is more important than ever. This refreshed project will continue to drive collaboration, networking, solutions and positive results for a sector that begins to emerge from crisis. The only industry meeting point that discusses, debates and provides answers to the future development of the sector. Delivering a conference arena for consultative content, an exhibition platform for trade deals and networking for business growth. Future Energy Nigeria is the dedicated professional project that Nigeria needs to support its ascent from its current challenges. 13 â€“ 14 November 2018 Eko Hotel & Suites, Lagos, Nigeria www.future-energy-nigeria.com
