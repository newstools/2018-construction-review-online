Construction work on the Kibwezi-Kitui road is well on course. The project which was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in December 2016, finally crossed the border of Makueni and Kitui counties at Athi Market last week, triggering celebrations among the locals. Until the milestone for the international trunk highway was achieved, the constituency did not have any tarmac road and residents have waited 55 years to see one. The US $182.1m road project which cuts across eight other constituencies, is situated in lower eastern region, starting at the junction of the Nairobi-Mombasa road near Kibwezi Town. It runs northward via Ikutha, Mutomo, Kitui, Kabati and ends at Migwani. Kitui South residents were ecstatic because, they said, they felt successive governments had marginalized the area for decades by failing to develop its infrastructure.

Ms Nyamai said once complete, the upgrading of the road to bitumen standard would facilitate faster movement of goods and services and unlock the economic potential of Makueni and Kitui counties.
