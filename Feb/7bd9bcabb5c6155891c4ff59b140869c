Affordable houses are set to be constructed in Kakamega County, Kenya as from May this year; Governor Wycliffe Oparanya confirmed the reports as he hosted teams from the Housing Finance Company (HFC) and the United Bank of Africa (UB-A). The initiative will eventually provide better and affordable housing to the residents as there is need for more middle class and high-end houses to cater for the increased middle class population.

Also present was Lands, Housing, Physical Planning and Urban CeC Alfred Matianyi, Robert Ambuku representing HFC Managing Director, County Secretary Dr Beatrice Sabana and the project contractor. In the elaborate partnership, the county government allots land as HFC provides mortgage for the scheme. United Bank of Africa on the other hand will finance the construction. Apart from Kakamega, the government is also doing spatial planning of Mumias town and other urban centres to ensure developing towns conform to the required standards and design. The ground-breaking of the mega project is slated for May 2018. The county is currently facing an acute shortage of residential and office space. It rents private buildings for some of its departments, while some county staff live in satellite towns due to lack of houses within town.
