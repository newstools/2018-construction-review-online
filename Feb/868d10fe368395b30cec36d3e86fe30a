The Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) will lead the training of engineers to fast track the construction of the standard gauge railway. This is according to the National Enterprise Corporation Managing Director, Maj Gen James Mugira, at the ministry of Defence headquarters in Mbuya, a Kampala suburb. NEC is a state Corporation that was established in 1989 as a commercial arm of the army. “We shall extend specialized training to all our officers in the UPDF Engineering Brigade including the wananchi (civilians) towards the realization of this big project,” he said. Gen Mugira was speaking at the welcome ceremony of ten UPDF/NEC officers who attained specialized training in railway construction from China’s Shijiazhuang Tiedao University.
