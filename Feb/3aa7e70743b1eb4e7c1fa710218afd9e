U.S. Government agency Power Africa and EnergyNet unite to bring African ministers and global leading businesses to Washington D.C to discuss opportunities to develop and invest in power projects. South Africa’s IPP programme is looking to be derestricted in the coming days. In addition to this the Uganda/Tanzania pipeline is advancing, Ghana’s energy programme is gaining momentum and Morocco is also preparing to tender its gas import terminal in June. Whilst these programmes are dominating headlines, there is more happening in Cote D’Ivoire, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Mali and beyond. EnergyNet announces the attendance of high level decision makers set to discuss these projects at the Powering Africa: Summit. Alongside the attendance of H.E. Irene Muloni, Minister for Energy, Mines and Minerals, Uganda, the summit confirms: “The exhibition side of the Powering Africa: Summit has already sold out which is a great progression from last year when sector confidence was waning. I believe this is a reflection of the growing optimism for projects in 2018.“ said Simon Gosling, Managing Director, EnergyNet Energynet is hosting the 2nd Latin America Energy Forum (LAEF) alongside the Powering Africa: Summit and will be running a non-geo specific ‘Tech and Tools’ stream open to delegates from both conferences. LAEF will focus heavily on gas and will welcome President of the International Gas Union, David Carroll as well as Wilson Ferreira Júnior, President of Eletrobras. Overall this will bring some 500 investors in energy to Washington D.C. this year.
