The airport is one of the 58 government owned airports and airstrips, operated, developed and managed by Tanzania Airports Authority (TAA). JNIA is about 12 km southwest of the city. The airport was formally known as Dar es Salaam International Airport (DIA) before it was renamed in 2006 in honor of Julius Kambarage Nyerere, the first President of the United Republic of Tanzania who died in 1999. The airport saves flights to and from different destinations including Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Currently there are two terminals, terminal one and terminal two. The government is constructing terminal three (TB III) which will be the largest terminal at JNIA with a capacity of handling up to 6,000,000 passengers annually.
