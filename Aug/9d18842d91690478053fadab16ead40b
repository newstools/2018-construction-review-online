Another large-scale project was realized recently by GILDEMEISTER energy solutions. This time in Namibia. A total of 6.5MWp is provided by the solar park, which supplies electricity to the largest Namibian cement factory. In addition to the central activity as general contractor, GILDEMEISTER energy solutions was responsible for the co-development of the project, developed by the German SunEQ GmbH as IPP. In contrast to many other parks of this size, the Ohorongo PV system does not feed the public grid, but directly supplies the neighbouring industrial customer, the largest cement factory in Namibia. It is a tracked system with an installed capacity of 6.5 MWp. At the end of June, the 20,000 solar modules installed will go into operation and feed around 14 GWh electricity per year directly into the cement plant network. “We put a lot of time and effort into the optimisation of the solar park in advance. AC / DC ratio, BOS costs, service concept: Everything was optimised in order to keep the leveled cost of energy (LCOE) as low as possible,” Christian Kleinhans, Head of Project Development at GILDEMEISTER energy solutions, explains. The solar park, which is so far unique in its size in the region, is seen nationwide as a flagship project and should be the basis for further construction projects with a similar structure. “The Namibian market in particular but especially southern Africa is very interesting for us and we´re looking forward to further projects in the region and the expansion of the development partnership with SunEQ”, says André Kremer, Managing Director of GILDEMEISTER energy solutions.
