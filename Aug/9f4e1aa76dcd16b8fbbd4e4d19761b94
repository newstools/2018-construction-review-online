The solar PV project for Liberty Midlands Mall will serve as the first initiative of its kind in our portfolio and will act as a benchmark for future solar plant project roll-outs,” he said. Liberty Midlands mall’s solar PV plant aligns with L2D’s strategy of investing in renewable energy for improved efficiency and the management of natural resources for the benefit of the environment. “We have put in place an effective framework to continually improve our environmental impact, an initiative that remains integral to our commitment to improve our operations,” Unsted added. The solar plant for the mall will be a grid tied, roof mounted PV installation made out of premium Mono Crystalline technology comprising 2 900 panels which will supply approximately 1 MW of energy to the mall and is designed and manufactured to last a minimum 25-year lifespan. The installation will be the largest commercial solar plant in the retail industry in Pietermaritzburg. The mall’s expansion will operate mainly on solar energy and be off the grid for most daylight hours. The installation of the plant will be done in September this year and will be commissioned on the roof of the mall’s 22 000 m2 Phase 3 extension that was launched in March. The completion date is set for the first quarter of 2019.
