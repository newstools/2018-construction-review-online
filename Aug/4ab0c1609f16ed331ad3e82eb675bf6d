Minister Nagbe dismissed speculations that the government was abandoning the two previous loan agreements, since the World Bank made the commitment and emphasized that the agreements are laws and they would be used to development road across the country. He further elaborated that ambassadors from countries including America and China and representatives of development partners requested President George Weah not to expand the country’s borrowing space. According to him, President Weah instead asked the ambassadors to help provide money to execute road projects across the country, since they want him to borrow in a sustainable way.
