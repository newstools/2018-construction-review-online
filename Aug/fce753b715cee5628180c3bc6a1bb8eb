The first trans-border gas pipeline in East Africa is set for construction. This is after Tanzania and Uganda signed a deal for the construction of a natural gas pipeline at the end of a three-day Joint Permanent Commission Summit held in Kampala. Confirming the reports was Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) managing director Kapuulya Musomba who said that the pipeline construction will be successful given the expertise and experience gained through the construction and servicing of two pipelines – the 532km Mtwara-Dar es Salaam one and the crude oil pipeline that is underway.

This will be the first trans-border gas pipeline in East Africa since the extraction of natural gas commenced in 2004 at the Songosongo Island in Tanzania’s southern region of Lindi. Other than carrying natural gas to Uganda, the pipeline will distribute the product along the route. The three-day Joint Permanent Commission Summit was led by Tanzania’s foreign minister Augustine Mahiga and Uganda’s minister of energy Irene Muloni.
