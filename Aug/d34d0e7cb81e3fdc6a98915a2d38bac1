The Government of Zimbabwe is seeking US $600m for the rehabilitation of Harare roads. This is according to Chief Engineer of Works George Munyonga who said the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Programme has a long way to go in addressing problems in most of Harare’s public transport routes. Speaking during a tour of some of the city’s roads under rehabilitation, Eng Munyonga also stated that the city is attending to 130km of roads of which 60 km have been completed, while work is still in progress for the remaining 30km. “We received funding of about US $12.9m from Zinara allocations and we also received US $2,8 m for the hot spots programme which is going to cover initially areas in Mbare, but we are going to extend it to other areas. We also received US $4.1 m from the Ministry of Finance which we used to carry out works in high order roads,” said Eng. George Munyonga.

If we finish our allocation early we can ask our city fathers for permission to look for more funds. The city is also not stationary, we are looking for an excess of US $600m in order to bring our roads to a manageable state,”he said. “We are also going to be attending to the side roads for Crowborough Way. This is the first phase for this programme and we hope that in the second phase we will be attending to all those other roads we have not been attending to,” he added. The city is also was working in Mufakose where works are ongoing on a targeted six roads, Marimba Road and other roads in Budiriro ensuring that all public transport routes are attended to before the end of the year. ‘We will also be attending to Hinn Road where we have been having a lot of muggings due to reduced traffic speeds that happen when roads are badly damaged,” said Eng Munyonga.
