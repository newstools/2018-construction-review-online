JCB has expanded its lineup of shovels by introducing an improved Multi Shovel attachment to offer more sizes and configurations while making changes to the attachment itself for more strength, capacity and durability. The attachment is designed for use on JCB Loadall telehandlers and combines a bucket and hydraulically-operated grab. The combination gives farmers and contractors the ability to haul loose materials and handle solid items like bales. The attachment’s end plate sections can also be taken off to allow the Multi Shovel to pick up tree trunks and branches. JCB says it has increased load capacity on the grab by optimizing the grab shape and ‘bite point’. A grab with forged tines that are bolted on and can be replaced is an available option. A new option is the weld-on toe plate in place of the standard bolt-on design. Bucket strength has also been increased on the new version of the attachment. JCB says it changed the design of the bucket from a two-piece shell to an 8 millimeter mono bloc structure. The new Multi Shovel also features a larger spill guard for better retention of loose materials.With the new grab and toe plate options there are now 32 variants of the 1.45, 1.59 and 1.66 cubic meter Multi Shovels. Toe plate widths are available in 2,150 mm (84.6 in.), 2,350 mm (92.5 in.) and 2,450 mm (96.4 in.).
