It will be the extension of West African Power Pool transmission network. Phase two of the project will entail construction of 15 substations of 225/30kW each. Two of the substations will be build in Gambia. The project is expected to take 18 months to complete the transmission works on the grid. Other member countries in the project include Senegal, Guinea Bissau and Guinea Conakry. “The OMVG transmission lines construction has today reached 16 contractors, and materials for the interconnection lines are already on the ground in all the four countries. We are looking at the renewable energy from the dams to be distributed to the countries,” said Dr Antonio Serifo Embalo, chairman, council of ministers, OMVG. “Already we have mobilized the financing, which is US $722 m. The four countries have signed the contracts. We are also working on the transmission and distribution lines all the way from The Gambia to Senegal,” he added.
