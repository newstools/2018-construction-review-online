Xtreme has introduced a new XR630 compact telehandler  which features 360-degree visibility for the operator to view the entire working area and added intuitive control that allows the operator to operate boom and chassis sway controls with one arm. The XR630 boasts 6 degrees of chassis sway that has a 6,000-pound lift capacity and is powered by a Tier 4 Final, 74-horsepower Deutz engine. For the boom, Xtreme added rollers for smoother operation and to eliminate chatter. The company also added a boom lift point for safer handling of suspended loads. Other features include Linde hydrostatic two-speed transmission, large cross-section boom with wear pads, easy service access, plastic dash with display screen, front and rear limited slip axles, plastic fenders and easy cab mounted grab handles. The telehandler has a lift height of 30 feet, 7 inches and forward reach of 18 feet, 5 inches. It weighs 13,700 pounds. Three cab options are available: open, enclosed with heat, and enclosed with heating and air conditioning. Tires are available in air-filled and foam-filled options. The XR630 also has a backup camera, flashing amber and green strobes, boom and rear cab work lights, locking fuel cap and machine lift points.
