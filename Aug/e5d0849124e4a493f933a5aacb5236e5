The Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) is set to construct a new fully-fledged campus in Kajiado County, Kenya. This is after the county government and the government institution came to an agreement. Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku confirmed the news and said that medical students who will be trained at the college will help supplement the efforts of the current workforce in the county’s hospitals in order to reinforce healthcare provision. Land has already been identified for the construction of the institution within the Kajiado Referral Hospital. This will be the second medical training college in the county after the one based in Loitokitok.

They will be instrumental in propelling the Big Four agenda of universal health coverage as championed by President Uhuru Kenyatta,” said Mr Lenku. He additionally pledged to allocate sufficient funds so as to help improve facilities within the institutions. This, he said, will be done in conjunction with like-minded investors which will see the county build classrooms and laboratories in the institutions. KMTC Board Chairman Philip Kaloki pointed out that the KMTC Loitokitok campus will be expanded to accommodate more courses that will ultimately see the students absorbed by the hospitals in their localities for the benefit of the people. The construction and expansion of the Kajiado and Loitokitok campuses comes hot on the heels of an elaborate training programme by the Kajiado County government and the KCB Foundation that saw 300 students sponsored to train in skills development, a venture that will see them empowered for self-employment and placement in the upcoming industries in the county.
