This will also demonstrate once again that renewable utility-scale power plants are the most effective solution to give access to electricity in the continent,” said Antonio Cammisecra, Head of EGP. Mr Antonio said that the Ngonye solar plant is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2019 and upon completion, the solar Pv Plant according to Enel is expected to produce a total capacity of 34MW and around 70GWh of electricity per year The government of Zambia has also set a goal of installing up to 600MW of solar power within the next two to three years with an aim of diversifying the country’s energy mix which is currently dominated by hydro power.
