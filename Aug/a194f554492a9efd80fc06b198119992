The construction of a low-cost housing project is set to kick start in Mombasa County, Kenya; this is in line with Kenya’s Big Four agenda. Land, Housing and Physical Planning executive Edward Dzila Nyale confirmed the reports saying that the county has a housing deficit of 380, 000 units and plans to erect 32,000 units in the next two years.

We will construct 14 floors in this area instead of the initial 24. From the technical survey the ground can only support fourteen,” Mr Nyale said. Mr Nyale pointed out that the estates earmarked for demolition and reconstruction in the first phase are Mzizima, Miritini Greenfields, Changamwe, Likoni (Flats and Customs) and Nyerere. The second phase involves the redevelopment of 12,000 housing units in Tudor Mwisho, Buxton, Tom Mboya, Kaa Chonjo, Khadija and Kizingo estates as envisaged in the County’s Vision 2035. The housing project is a key pillar in Vision 2035 and the county plans to have units in the said estates completed between 18-34 months. In line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four Agenda, Mombasa’s development blueprint seeks to create a vibrant economy with a focus on SMEs in a bid to create jobs for the youth and women. Goal Four on affordable housing links well with Mombasa county’s endeavour to improve access to water and sanitation, create a sustainable environment and develop modern transport infrastructure.
