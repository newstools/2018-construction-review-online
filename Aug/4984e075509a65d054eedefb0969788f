The Government of Gabon through its financial institution, Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC) has signed an agreement with ENGIE to construct eight hybrid solar power plants with a combined capacity of 2.2 MW in the country. Construction of the project is set to begin in a few weeks and upon completion it will contribute to Gabon’s proactive policy of using renewable energy, solar and hydro power, to increase the country’s energy capacities.

Ausar Energy offers the African continent a hybrid solar power plant solution in line with ENGIE Group’s strategy of promoting decentralized generation and distribution of electricity from renewable sources, with or without storage facilities, with capacities ranging from 50kW to 2.5MW. The project is set to save the country one million litres of fuel oil per year or 2,600 tonnes of CO2 and reduce generation costs by 30%.This strategic priority is designed to ensure continuous access to energy in isolated areas that are not and cannot be connected to grids, as well as to limit the consumption of fuel oil, manage costs and reduce pollution.
