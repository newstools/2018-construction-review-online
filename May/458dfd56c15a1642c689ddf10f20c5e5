Cement consumption in Kenya has hugely decreased for the first time in 17 years. Its use has gone down by a whopping 6.2 million tonnes and this is mainly due to the low demand that is currently being experienced in the construction sector; this is according to the Economic Survey 2018 released by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). The last time there was such a decrease was in 2000 when it stood at 1.067 million tonnes compared to 1.111 million tonnes the preceding year.
