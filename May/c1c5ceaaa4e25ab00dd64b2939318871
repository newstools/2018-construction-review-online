Africa’s longest suspension bridge that is under construction in Mozambique is set for commissioning on the 25th of June this year; same date as Mozambique’s independence in 1975. Known as the Maputo-Catembe Bridge, the US $700m worth bridge, is part of a larger project that includes a set of access roads on both banks and other roads, including one leading to Ponta do Ouro, a beach area near the border with the province of Natal in South Africa.

The 3km-long bridge aims to connect Maputo with Catembe on the southern part of Maputo Bay cutting down the driving time to four hours from the initial nine hours taken to drive round the bay. With a width of 680m, it will also be able to carry high volumes of traffic comfortably in both directions. This will replace the current ferry system and various fragmented road systems that transport goods and tourists from South Africa and Swaziland into Mozambique. Maputo-Catembe Bridge will also pave way for development at the Catembe area, particularly in commercial and housing sectors, overcoming the problem of a lack of space for more buildings in the capital city. Apart from being Africa’s longest suspension bridge, the Maputo-Catembe will also be ranked among the 60 largest suspended bridges in the world.
