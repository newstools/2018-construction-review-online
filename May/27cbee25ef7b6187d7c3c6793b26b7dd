When installing any type of wire or wiring system, there is always a risk involved.  Hurting yourself, someone else or loss of property if the wires are not properly installed are some of the dangers involved. There are however proactive measures that can be taken when you are working with or installing wires. Figuring out where and how you’ll be using power makes it easier to frame the parameters of the job. Check out local codes and pull permits as they set standards for everything from how many outlets you’ll put in each room to what kind of wire you’ll be using. Part of avoiding damage is making sure nobody punches holes in plumbing or existing wiring. Live by the words “Ask twice, drill once” to be on the safer side If dealing with a damage done by rewiring, make cleanup and restoration as early as possible. These are when a wire runs directly from a circuit breaker to an outlet, with no other devices on that breaker, thus reducing loads on the power system and keep popped breakers to a minimum, creating a balanced system. Make sure the power is always off before starting any electrical work and if possible make sure everyone in the area knows it is turned off for a reason. It may seem logical but it’s critical for a safe work environment Covering your eyes is a must when dealing with electricity to avoid sparks or other debris to get in your eyes. Having the right tools for a wire installation is important. Some tools include: a voltage tester, wire cutters, wire and cable strippers, needle nose pliers, continuity tester, and others. It is best to have a trusted, professional electrician do any electrical project. But if you are handling it yourself, follow all safety precautions from the beginning to the end of a project to help ensure the safety of you, your neighbors and your property. It will also guarantee the longevity.
