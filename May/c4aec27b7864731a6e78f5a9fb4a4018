Kenya Urban Roads Highway Authority (Kura) has completed the construction of the first footbridge along the Outer Ring road in Nairobi, Kenya. The new footbridge is constructed at the Baba Dogo section of the newly constructed road that runs from Taj Mall on North Airport Road to the GSU headquarters at Allsops in Ruaraka. The Chinese firm Sinohydro Tianjin Engineering Limited, is responsible for the construction of the pedestrian footbridge. Initially, the 13km road did not have service lanes and had no single footbridge for pedestrian crossing. At a cost of US $8.8m, the Chinese construction company is expected to construct 10 more footbridges  along the North Airport Road. According to Kura, the first Footbridge along Outer Ring Road at Baba Dogo section has been successfully installed, and installation works are ongoing along the entire road corridor. Since September 2014, Outer Ring Road has been under construction whereby its initial construction completion was scheduled for September last year. However, the construction project did not conclude as expected. Nonetheless, the road project now has a new completion deadline which is July 2018. Moreover, the road has been operational since July last year given that most of the construction works are already complete. Under the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) is a State Corporation established by the  Kenya  Roads  Act,  2007  with  the  core  mandate  of Management, Development, Rehabilitation and Maintenance of National urban trunk roads. KURA is also an ISO 9001:2008 certified Authority.
