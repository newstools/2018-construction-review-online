Caterpillar has introduced an updated version of its PL61 pipe-layer that the company says offers improved maneuverability, performance and has new safety features.. Powered by a Cat C4.4 ACERT Tier 4 Final engine delivering 130 horsepower, the PL61 provides 40,000 pounds of maximum load capacity in an easy to transport 128-inch width. On the new model, Cat has improved the machineâ€™s steering for faster response allowing for increased maneuverability on the pipeline. The new pipe-layer also packs an improved fuel system which stands up better to lower quality fuel. A cold weather package is available on the machine, offering greater cab comfort and more reliable engine performance and starting in cold weather. The machine is available with either an open or closed ROPS cab. All Cat pipe-layers now feature a rear window exit and a quick drop release function for added safety. Cat is also offering an optional rear vision camera on the PL61 along with a load monitor indicator (LMI). The LMI is a mandatory attachment where required to meet regional regulations.
