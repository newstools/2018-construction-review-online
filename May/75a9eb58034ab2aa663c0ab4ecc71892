The new oxygen plant will come in handy as it will be capable of filling cylinders and supplying oxygen for the Operating Theaters, Emergency Room and treatment areas of the new ELWA hospital. Also, any excess bottled oxygen not used by the hospital will be sold at a small fee to other medical facilities in the Monrovia area. The new facility is projected to be complete in the next six months. Additionally, equipment is set to be purchased and installed by then and staff trained for effective operations of the plant.
