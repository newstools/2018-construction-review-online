Rwanda is currently experiencing a cement shortage that has seen its price skyrocket; this is after key players in the local construction sector and other stakeholders confirmed the price increase that has been experienced since March this year. The shortage which has since led to a significant rise in prices, has derailed several construction projects in the country.

However, the company confirmed that supplies will soon return to normalcy in a few weeks time. As a result of the shortage, the price of a bag of Cimerwa cement increased in some areas representing a 49% rise. The shortage has also pushed up prices for cement imports. For instance, Hima and Tororo cement (Uganda), which beforehand went for US $10 a bag is now US $17. The cement shortage will automatically affect the construction industry in the region. CIMERWA is Rwandaâ€™s only integrated cement producer with a production plant in Bugarama, Rusizi district in South Western border of Rwanda. The company which mines raw materials, produces the clinker concentrate, packs and sells cement for general and civil construction, and also exports to neighbouring countries such as DRC and Burundi. Having invested US $170m in a new modern dry process production plant at its head office in Bugarama, it now has a capacity to turn out 600,000 tons of cement annually.
