At the moment, they are working on finishing Kinyerezi I extension project to produce 185MW. The government has committed US $188m to implement the Kinyerezi I extension project which will hopefully be complete by January next year. “There are many other power projects which are ongoing because of President Magufuli’s efforts. In the next three or four years, Kinyerezi area alone in the city will be generating about 1,690MW from the natural gas,” he said. Stiegler’s Gorge power project is expected to add more power thus drive industrialization. TANESCO’s Managing Director, Dr Tito Mwinuka said that they look forward to embarking on implementing Kinyerezi III and IV which will be generating 600MW and 450MW respectively. Dr Mwinuka further explained that talks are ongoing with investors so that the implementation of the two projects could start in the 2019/20 financial year. According to Mr. Hiroyuki Kubota, the Deputy Ambassador of Japan to Tanzania, the quality and safety standards have been achievable during the construction of the Kinyerezi II. He made an assurance that Japan was supporting the industrial agenda of the Fifth Phase Government, and the Kinyerezi II power project proves their support.
