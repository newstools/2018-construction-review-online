The Southern African Plastic Pipe Manufacturers Association (SAPPMA) has resolved to remain steadfast in their focus on quality; taking an unwavering stand when it comes to pipe manufacturers who fail to comply with the set standards. According to Jan Venter, the CEO, it has always been SAPPMA’s mandate to ensure that our members only produce and market top quality products that are fully compliant to all relevant standards and specifications, to promote and ensure ethical business activities in all areas of operation and to ensure that the SAPPMA mark is used to clearly differentiate between quality producers and others. “We have not hesitated to act against members who are found guilty of taking short-cuts or failed to meet their standards during various announced and unannounced factory audits,” he added. Mr. Venter further added that, due to the enormous expenditure on research and development by polymer manufacturers, modern pipe grade materials have such excellent properties that it is now impossible for any pipe engineer to ignore them. “This is highlighted by the dominant market position of plastic pipe in just about all pressure water and gas pipe as well as sewerage applications. However, the plastic pipe industry is also facing growing temptation to cut corners for the sake of saving a few rands,” he said. According to the CEO SAPPMA represents more than 80% of the pipe manufacturers in South Africa who have all agreed to the set Code of Conduct and voluntarily committed themselves to maintain the highest ethical standards in all their professional dealings. “Seeing the SAPPMA mark displayed on pipes therefore gives the quality assurance that the product will last in excess of 100 years without failure because it was manufactured according to the highest quality standards. We are willing to lose members and make the unpopular, hard decisions to ensure that the integrity of our brand, our name and our industry remain intact,” he affirmed.
