Construction work is ongoing on at the new transit shed at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). The transit shed is aimed at expanding the facility’s cargo handling capacity by more than 10%. Due to the rising air cargo competition from South Africa and Ethiopia as well as the rise in exports, especially horticulture, the construction work is expected to increase the number of transit sheds to six. Once completed, the transit shed will add the uplifts capacity of cargo facilitation at the airport. The Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) is enhancing its exit and import handling capacity by 10,000 square metre in a bid to handle the increased tonnage of horticulture, which is one the country’s major exports.
