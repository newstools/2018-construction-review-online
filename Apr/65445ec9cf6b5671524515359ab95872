Plans are underway for the construction of the second container terminal at Côte d’Ivoire’s main port of Abidjan. French industrial conglomerate Bollore has plans to invest US $496.3m from next year towards the terminal construction project. This is according to Bollore Transport and Logistics Deputy CEO, Philippe Labonne. Côte d’Ivoire authorities want the main port of Abidjan to become a regional hub. Currently, the port is used to ship cocoa beans from the world’s top cocoa producer, and is also a vital supply and export route for landlocked countries to the north. According to Philippe Labonne, the terminal project is scheduled to kick start in June or July next year. “It’s a question of building a platform and setting up the port equipment,” said Labonne. The new terminal will be operational from June 2020 and will be financed by the project’s partner Maersk. Meanwhile, the port authorities through the Chinese’s help are currently widening the canal leading to the port to reach a 16m depth that will allow larger ships to dock.
