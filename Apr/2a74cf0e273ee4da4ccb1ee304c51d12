Construction work on the longest concrete road project in Nigeria is set to kick off. Dangote Group has been awarded the contract for the Nigeria’s longest rigid pavement on the Obajana-Kabba road project in Kogi State. According to a statement issued by Ashif Juma, the Managing Director of AG-Dangote Construction Company, the project will be completed as agreed. The 44km Obajana- Kabba road is said to be the longest concrete road project ever constructed in Nigeria. Moreover, the project is also one of the country’s roads that will link the North and the South of Nigeria. Dangote Group has urged the Nigerian government to switch over to constructing roads using concrete instead of asphalt. It describes concrete as superior, durable and cheaper, and it does not require frequent maintenance. Other companies are also called to emulate the Dangote Group.
