China is set to construct a new ECOWAS Headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria. This is after they signed a memorandum of understanding with The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). According to the agreement, Beijing will fund and build the new headquarters at a cost of US $32m. Also, China will maintain the new building for three years following its completion. This is a good initiative since the development will consolidate ECOWAS operations in one building from the three it now uses. The number of staff in the commission had also increased making the development a necessity. The President of the ECOWAS Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Brou and the Ambassador of China to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Mr. Zhou Pingjian were all present to sign for both parties during a bilateral meeting held at the ECOWAS Commission headquarters in Abuja. Mr. Brou thanked the Chinese government for the grant and further expressed the region’s Commitment to foster the ECOWAS-China cooperation.
