Rehabilitation work on the 111km road connecting the Mbanza Kongo town and the Lukunga town in Angola has been suspended for correction of the base solution and the wear layer. The suspension decision was reached after a site visit by the Minister of Construction and Public Works, Manuel Tavares de Almeida. Before the suspension the rehabilitation work was at 75%. So far, the gravel pavement coated with glue has already been applied on 20km of the road. Furthermore, to guarantee greater road durability, the Angolan Engineering Laboratory (LEA) will be working with the Angola Roads Institute (INEA) to find an economical solution. Since February 2009, Tecnovia Angola company has been handling the Mbanza Kongo road repair works which initially started in January 2011.
