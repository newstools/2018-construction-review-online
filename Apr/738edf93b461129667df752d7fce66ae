The construction of multi-million dollars hostels in Kenya is set to commence soon; this is after five joint ventures and a Chinese firm were shortlisted for the development. The three public universities which are set to increase students accommodation by more than 23,400 beds are Moi, Embu and South Eastern Kenya (Seku) universities. Moi University under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement pre-qualified Kesa, Meridiam, JV Unicamp and PDM-Roko-CBA Capital Consortiums and Chinese Overseas Engineering for construction of the 14, 000 units.

Also, South Eastern Kenya University shortlisted Kesa and PDM-Roko for the proposed 5,400 units at its Machakos-based main campus. The successful bidders will be required to finance, design, construct and maintain the hostels, on a build-own-operate basis. This initiative will in so doing enable the three universities to cater for the current hostels shortage that most students are experiencing forcing them to seek accommodation outside the institutions. The new hostels will not only accommodate students but will also have separate study areas and food supply facilities along with tuck shops. Apart from the above three learning institutions, JKUAT, Maseno, Egerton and Kenya School of Government have also sought to avail land to private developers for hostels. Moi and Kenyatta universities had in 2014 been cleared for such PPP hostel projects.
