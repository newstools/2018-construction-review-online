A new environment-friendly wastewater treatment plant has been launched in South Africa by Murray & Roberts Water (MRW) together with its European technology partner, Organica Water. The plant which resembles a greenhouse at the eThekwini municipality’s Verulam Wastewater Treatment Works, is the first of its kind in the country. This is because it does away with the unpleasant odour regularly associated with wastewater treatment facilities and also produces 30% less sludge. It also uses 30% less energy and has a 50% to 75% smaller geographic footprint.

The reactors then complement the often highly urbanized environments in which they are situated. Organica Water senior manager Oscar Palomino confirmed the reports and said that, with the new technology, the plant can be placed anywhere hence reducing the infrastructure costs to connect to customers thus enhances land value around the facility. He added and pointed out that for the first time, this facility has a combination of engineering, chemistry and sophisticated information technology with architecture. “This is a water reclamation garden, educational facility and symbol of sustainability in the community that enables cost-efficient water reuse and allows for maximized development opportunities, particularly in populated areas where footprint and odour are significant concerns,” he said. eThekwini Water and Sanitation municipality is currently monitoring the progress and would consider investing in this technology for planned upgrades of water infrastructure that will be needed in the near future.
