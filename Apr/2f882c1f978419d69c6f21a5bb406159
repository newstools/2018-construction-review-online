Plans are underway for the construction of Nduli Airport in  Iringa Region, Tanzania. Currently, Tanzania has 10 existing and operational airports. The plans come after a just completed feasibility study on the airport project. The Tanzanian government has set aside funds to kick start the construction of the Airport. The Project’s tender has also been issued for interested and qualified bidders. Responding to a question posed by MP Ritta Kabati as to why until now there is no jet fuel station at the planned airport despite government promising that the station would now be in place, Deputy Minister of Works, Transport and Communications, Joseph Kwandikwa replied that, the airport project is yet to kick start to warrant the construction of a jet fuel station at the project site.
