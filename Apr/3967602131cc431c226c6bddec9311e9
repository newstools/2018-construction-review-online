Kenya is currently seeking for international and local joint ventures to help construct 8,000 low-cost housing units in Mavoko, Machakos; this is after domestic firms failed the test to execute the mega housing development. Confirming the reports was Transport, Infrastructure and Urban Development Cabinet secretary, Mr. James Macharia who said that the initiative was meant to fast-track the mass housing development in the region.

We however encourage joint ventures that will promote local companies’ capacity as well as foster a practical technology-transfer platform,” he said. Mr. Macharia pointed out that so far, 35 companies had been shortlisted for the pilot project under an engineering and procuring construction model. The model gives room for winning bidders to source for financing and put up the houses using affordable (of below US$ 15,000) designs and technologies that are time-efficient and of very high quality. “We plan to have the ground breaking within the next three months in Mavoko region. However, we have an objective of being part of the 47 counties in Kenya where each county will have a project executed while densely populated counties such as Nairobi, Mombasa, Kiambu and Kisumu among others, will witness more high-rise residential housing projects,” he added. In the recent past, Kenya has witnessed the launch of alternative building technology firms which include China Wu Yi Precast Company for building material among others.
