The projected construction of the 35-floor triple tower in Kilimani area by Cytonn Investments’ is already facing challenges as residents of the area are opposed to it being built. Kilimani Project Foundation argues that the construction will mainly disrupt lives and businesses in the area. Also, they said that the health of children attending an early childhood development centre in the area is at stake since the project is “of such a magnitude” that will involve numerous truck movements and activities within and around the site.

However, Cytonn on the other hand called for a restraint saying all issues raised would be addressed by environmental and engineering experts it had hired thereby helping mitigate the concerns raised by the public. “We note the concerns from the public and wish to say that the statement is hysterical and is informed by narrow commercial interests that do not take into consideration the due process that the development is following,” Cytonn said in a statement. The US $200m project – ‘Cytonn Towers’ is scheduled to commence construction and take four years to be complete. It will comprise of a 180- room hotel, 30 office floors and 160 serviced apartments. It seeks to meet the luxury housing demand, premier business office space and hotel and conferencing facilities. The mega development will hopefully sit on a four-acre piece of land at the junction of Elgeyo Marakwet and Argwings Kodhek Roads.
