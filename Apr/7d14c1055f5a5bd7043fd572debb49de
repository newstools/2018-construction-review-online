The Tennis Kenya Training Centre (TKTC) which will be constructed at the Kasarani Sports Complex is projected to be complete in two years time. This initiative will eventually make tennis a public sport available for Kenyans from all walks of life. President Uhuru Kenyatta confirmed the reports during a meeting with the officials from the Ministry of Sports, International Tennis Federation, African Tennis Confederation and Tennis Kenya.

The other ITF training centre in Africa is in Morocco. Currently, US $300,000 has already been allocated by the Government for the construction to commence while the rest of the funds will be allocated through the next budget. Additionally, 10 acres of land has also been set aside at the Kasarani Sports Complex for the construction of the training centre. The National Youth Service and the Ministry of Sports are contributing towards its development. Principal Secretary Ministry of Sports Peter Kaberia said tennis has not taken root because of the lack of public courts but that will change with the development of the centre at Kasarani. “The development of the new training centre will ultimately bring the tennis sport to life since public courts and other necessities will be available,” he said. Nairobi will also be a hub for tennis in Eastern and Southern Africa and the centre will possibly be a source of huge revenue from sports tourism when it hosts tennis features.
