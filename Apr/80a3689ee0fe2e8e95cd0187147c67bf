A whopping US$ 20m has been secured by the Kericho County Government for the construction of affordable housing in the region. This is in accordance with the development agenda by the president of the Republic. The funds which will come a long way in helping to kick start the programme is from an investor from the United Arab Emirates, the County will only need to provide land for the development to commence.

Once the project is complete, tenants will be required to pay in installments for ownership of the houses instead of rent which is the common means used in most areas. This is a very good initiative that will help transform the counties and better the lives of citizens, especially the poor. The other items on the president’s ‘Big Four’ agenda are universal healthcare, food security and manufacturing.

The Kenya Economic Update: Housing—Unavailable and Unaffordable, attributes the slowdown in economic activity to slow credit growth, the ongoing drought, and rising global oil prices.
