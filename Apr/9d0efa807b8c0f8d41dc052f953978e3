On completion the bridge will connect people and improve their natural flow in large numbers through a reorganization of vehicular, waterways, and pedestrian modes of transportation. The bridge construction will have two levels which will not only function as a means for vehicular traffic on its upper level, it will  also stimulate and accommodate pedestrian, social, commercial and cultural interactions on it’s lower level. Additionally, in conjunction with existing road networks, the Fourth Mainland Bridge will establish a primary ring road around Lagos. The ring road is expected to provide alternative traffic routes from Lekki to Ikorodu, Ikeja to Ajah, relieving the 3rd Mainland bridge of its overstretched capacity. With the improved flow of people across Lagos, the city will be relieved of traffic congestion, and rather maximize its great opportunities and grow better.
