The South African Wind Energy Association (SAWEA) is working with key constituencies to help improve the implementation of Economic Development components through industry practice. A final workshop in a series hosted by SAWEA brought together key representatives of the three constituencies concerned with economic development in the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REI4P). Parties included Economic Development Directors of Project companies, Community Trustees and employees of Community Trusts.  SAWEA explained in a statement that each of these groups focus on the implementation of distinct facets of local economic development in rural communities adjacent to wind farms in the Northern, Eastern and Western Capes. According to Brenda Martin, CEO of SAWEA, the series of workshop were organized to improve collective understanding of the purpose, challenges and opportunities associated with Community Trusts. “As the industry association for wind power in South Africa, SAWEA is concerned with both the socio-economic and operational contributions of the national utility-scale renewable procurement programme,” she said. Participants used the opportunity to improve mutual understanding of the policy basis for Economic development in the RE procurement programme and to lay a foundation for increased effectiveness of Trusts across provinces. Representing each of the three provinces which now boast the highest volume of renewable energy utility power plants in South Africa, participants recognized the value of improved collective knowledge to ensure more effective, engaged Community Trusts. Improved collective knowledge will also enable the three constituencies to drive improved effectiveness of implementation in compliance with existing renewable programme rules, and to recommend adjustments to future rules.
