Netherlands-based company, Prysmian, has been selected by NAMPOWER to supply power cables worth between  US $1.6m after undertaking a scouting mission to Europe in February last year. The cables are needed for the 132kV Hippo substation, whose tender was awarded to the Consolidated Power Engineering Namibia Company (Conco) on 10 October 2016. The substation has since been completed and was energized on 22 August 2018 – three months after the agreed date. NamPower managing director Simson Haulofu, the divisional manager for transmission, AJ Vermeulen, and the chief officer for power systems development, Reiner Jagau used the emergency procurement process to push through the Prysmian deal. According to Jagau, Nampower used the emergency method because the transformers are from the 70s, and the electricity supply to the north is under threat. “The solution to this problem has been delayed for more than two years now, so to get at least the supply, we need to commission,” Jagau stated. Jagau said that Nampower’s technical and procurement staff visited three factories – NKT in Germany, Brugg in Switzerland and Prysmian of The Netherlands – and eventually decided on Prysmian because Eskom SA had recommended the company. The technical and procurement team had detailed discussions and decided on Prysmian because it was agreeable to NamPower’s set requirements. According to Jagua, although the money was approved long ago, the delivery of the cables would take months. “Such goods take many, many months. Commission of the first set will not be before April 2019,” Jagau said. NamPower board chair Kauna Ndilula said the board had approved all bids. “The Hippo 132kV switching station bid was awarded to Conco Namibia in 2016 and is nearing completion. The original Hippo budget has not been adjusted, nor has Conco’s work been extended/increased as alleged. All the other work has been budgeted for,” Ndilula said.
