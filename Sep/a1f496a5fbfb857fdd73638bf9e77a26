The road beside the mountain is very small and Landslides happen easily. When a new access road needed to be constructed, local officials selected ECOWEB‘s EcowebEC100-356 Geocells. Geocell is a new type of Geosynthetics Product, a three- dimensional system made with ultrasonically- welded High density Polyethylene(HDPE) that are expanded on site to form a a honeycomb- like structure which may be filled with sand ,soil,rock or concrete etc EcowebEC100-356 Geocells This geosynthetic solution gave is an efficient, low-cost, long-life solution that is less invasive for the environment. To support the mountain road, approximately 28,000m2 of geocells from Ecoweb were supplied. Ecoweb EC100-356 were supplied in textured, perforated, green colored construction.The engineered design enabled strong retention of road fill while also enabling drainage.To keep the system from ponding, the green color allowed the panels to bend into the environment so that if a panel section was exposed it would not be visually disruptive to the environment. The EC100-356 entails various features such as; easy transportation and installation , can endure all weather conditions without compromising installation speed and safety. It also has a longer life span than other geosynthetics designs and the geocell stability reduces the frequency of mountain road maintenance which reduces the cost of the system.
