Nigeria has secured the support of the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, for the construction of the 3,050MW Mambila hydro power project, the largest in the country situated in Taraba state. President Muhammadu Buhari said that Mambilla Hydropower Project remains a key priority for the government and that he hoped to fund the project with concessionary loans from China. “I told President Xi that the Mambilla Hydropower Plant is Nigeria’s equivalent of China’s Three Gorges Dam, and that our hope is to fund the project with concessionary loans from China as any alternative funding arrangement will adversely impact the project’s viability. I am fully committed to the realization of this landmark project and i look forward to him joining me for the groundbreaking ceremony in the not-too-distant future,” said the President.

We hope that with your kind intervention, this assessment will be expedited. Your Excellency, Mambilla is Nigeria’s equivalent of the Three Gorges Dam,” said Buhari.
