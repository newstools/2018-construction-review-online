Nigeria is set to complete 86 units of the Emoten gardens in Edo state by end of this year. This will act as a show phase as the rest of the units are built. Isoken Omo, the Executive Chairman, Edo Development and Property Agency (EDPA) said that the first set of home owners will not only live there but will also have access to infrastructures such as electricity, lawns and road. She further said that they are now painting the houses in the model house row. “Although some are at the block stage and others at the roof stage, we will deliver all of them by December,” Ms. Omo confidently declared. The first phase is divided into different categories. These are 4-bedroom stand-alone bungalows, terrace houses, 3-bedroom with a maid quarters; 2 and 3-bedroom semi-detached; 3-bedroom semi-detached; blocks of flats and four 2-bedroom in a row; 3-bedroom row of houses. The 2-bedroom cluster house goes at a starting price of US$ 17,000. The prices escalates according to the type of house one purchases. Ms. Omo further explained that there were residential plots of 450 sq. land or 900 sq. land for those who prefer building for themselves as long as they adhere to the design guide. According to her, the design is to ensure homogeneity. There will also be commercial plots with shopping malls built in them.

Together with the entry fee, one is required to have a Know Your Customer (KYC) form and a 25% down payment at expression of interest. Ms. Omo explained that the KYC form was to ensure money came from a clean channel. Once completed, one pays the deposit and the EDPA sends them an offer letter with the terms of payment. 80% of the building materials for the Emotan Gardens project are locally acquired.
