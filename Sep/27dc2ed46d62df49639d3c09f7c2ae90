The government of Kenya has postponed its plan to build nuclear power plant worth US $10bn by nine years to 2036 in favour of renewable energy projects and coal plant. The Ministry of Energy confirmed the reports through an updated power development plan which showed the earliest the country can commence with the nuclear plant plans is 2036 and not 2027 as initially planned.

However, it is noteworthy that nuclear was not brought on board in both optimised and fixed MTP cases,” reads the updated plan shared by the Ministry. Additionally the country has also scaled down the plan size.  Kenya was to construct two nuclear power plants, each with a capacity of 1,000MW at a total cost of $4.05 billion  per plant. The new plan is to have each plant with a capacity of 600MW at a cost of US $4.84 bn. Kenya joins South Africa South Africa, which in August cancelled plans to add 9,600 MW of nuclear power by 2030 and will instead aim to add more capacity in natural gas, wind and other energy sources. It had already sought a partner to produce the nuclear power by 2022 to help match-up rising demand and diversify from hydropower and geothermal.
