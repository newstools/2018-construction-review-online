It is expected to create over 1600 job opportunities. Upon completion estimated to be after 18 months, the project will deliver around two million tonnes of LNG annually, contributing 30% of Ghana’s total electricity generating capacity. This according to the President will ensure constant, reliable and affordable power supply in the  country. Additionally, a concession agreement has been signed between the Ghana Ports and Harbor Authority (GPHA) and the Tema LNG Terminal Company to allow the development and operation of the facility within the Tema Port. China Harbour Engineering Company, which is currently expanding the Tema port, will construct the marine facilities for the terminal, while Jiangnan Shipyard of China will build the floating regasification facility. The terminal is expected to be transferred to the Ghana Government after 12years.
