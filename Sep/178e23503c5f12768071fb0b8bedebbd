Five new clinics are set to be constructed in Masvingo West Constituency in Zimbabwe following an agreement by the Zimbabwe Defense Forces under its community assistance programme. The five clinics will be constructed using the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) and will be a great boost to the health delivery system in the rural district. Speaking during the official handover of two Early Childhood Education blocks, Masvingo West Member of Parliament Cde Ezra Chadzamira said his constituency was poised for better things ahead owing to its close relationship with the army. The blocks were recently constructed by the ZDF. “I think the army should set up base in this community because we have also requested 4 Infantry Brigade to assist us in the construction of five clinics in this constituency,” he added.

The clinics will be located at Neshuro, Bhuka, Zvehuru, Zvemahandi and Bere under Chief Charumbira. Construction works are expected to commence soon at Neshuro Clinic. However, Zvemahandi clinic will be constructed by artisans from Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services. “All the projects should be complete by early next year given that we have mobilized all the required materials,” the MP said. Cde Chadzamira expressed optimism that the five projects would be completed on schedule. This he said because of the army’s proven commitment and record to do their job on time. “We are optimistic that the projects will be complete within a short time given the caliber of our artisans from the army,” he said.
