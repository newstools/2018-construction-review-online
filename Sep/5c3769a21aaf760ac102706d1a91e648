We could not have asked for a better partner than Investec Property,” he said. The Chairperson added that the property will be interwoven into family-friendly oriented spaces with easy access to main arterial roads and motorways in a bid to optimize energy distribution and usage and have access to smart connectivity. On his part, Investec Property Director, Mr. Robin Magid said they were thrilled in launching the new project. “We have worked alongside some of the best and most creative brains in the business to develop our vision of creating a sustainable, technologically advanced development depicting a deep connection between the natural and the built environment,” he added. The new development will also incorporate the existing Wanderers Golf Club clubhouse and parking area and will extend along Rudd Road and out towards the Wanderers rugby fields on Corlett Drive.
