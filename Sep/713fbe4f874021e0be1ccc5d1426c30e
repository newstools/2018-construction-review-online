Angola’s Independent Power Producers (IPP) has received a US $1m grant from the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) managed by the African Development Bank to boost private investment in renewable energy. Amadou Hott, the African Development Bank’s Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth confirmed the reports and said the grant will be used to establish a one-stop shop unit known as the Energy Project Implementation Support Unit (EPISU). “This project will enable and stimulate investments through IPPs in the Angolan renewable energy sector. It also complements the US $1 billion Bank’s Power Sector Reform Support Program to the ongoing energy sector reforms undertaken by the country,” said Amadou Hott.

SEFA is a multi-donor facility established to unlock private sector investments in small to medium sized clean energy projects in Africa, operating through three components; (i) grants to facilitate the preparation of renewable energy generation and energy efficiency projects towards bankability (ii) equity investments to bridge the financing gap for renewable energy generation projects and; (iii) support to public sector in improving the enabling environment for private investments in sustainable energy. The US $1m investment is also in line with Angola’s National Adaptation Program for Action (NAPA), which aims to promote renewable energy  and extend rural electricity grids.
