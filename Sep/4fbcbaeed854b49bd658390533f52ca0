Kenya has commenced on the construction of the US $30m new centre at Kenyatta National Hospital which set to compensate for the recent increase in patients at the hospital. Dr Thomas Mutie, acting Chief Executive Officer of The Kenyatta National Hospital confirmed the reports and said the centre will be designed as a three-storey twin tower building. The centre will feature a burns unit, children’s wing, cancer hostel, and an intensive care unit (ICU).The burns unit and paediatrics wing will both be constructed with an 82-bed capacity, whilst the ICU will have a capacity for 24 beds.

Funding of the mega project will majorly be from Kenya’s government, the Arab Bank for Development in Africa (BADEA), and the Saudi Fund for Development. US $2m will be provided by the American Cancer Society and local donors, and will be used for the cancer hostel. “Cancer patients require six cycles of treatment which can be completed in 10 days and that is why the hostel is important,” Mutie continued.
