The 60MVA power transformer installed in Okpella state, has increased the power capacity of Okpella substation from 15MVA to 75MVA. This additional power will greatly support the industrial policy of Edo government, given the existence of huge deposit of limestone and other solid minerals in the area. She said the BUA cement factory at Okpella would also enjoy the improved power supply in the area. Several communities including Okpella, BUA Cement Company, Aghenebode town and environs that are customers of Benin Electricity Distribution Company are also expected to experience improved power supply. The Papalanto substation has also increased its power capacity from 75MVA to 132MVA following the installation of the new 60MVA power transformer. Mrs. Mbah said the 60MVA at Papalanto would be commissioned by the Minister of Power Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola at a later date. The TCN spokesperson also added that electricity users in Ilaro, Lapeleke, Sango, Onihale and environs in Ogun state who are customers of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company would experience improved power supply.
