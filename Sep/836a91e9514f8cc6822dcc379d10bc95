Ireland-based Mainstream Renewable Power is getting ready to commence a major construction activity on the 110 MW Perdekraal East Wind Farm project to the northeast of Ceres in the Western Cape, South Africa. “These are early days in the project, but we are gearing up and expect to have excavated four foundations by the end of this month,” Glenn Hobson, Construction Project Manager, said in a statement. Since reaching financial close in June, the construction team has been working on establishing on-site infrastructure, clearing and grubbing of roads and turbine foundations, the developer noted. The project involves erecting 48 wind turbines at a site in the Witzenberg Local Municipality that will be generating some 183,000 GWh of electricity per year upon completion. The scheme was awarded as part of the country’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP). A month ago, private equity fund manager African Infrastructure Investment Managers (AIIM) said it had acquired majority stakes in a portfolio of nine wind and solar projects in South Africa with a combined value of 800 MW, including Perdekraal. Mainstream was founded in 2008 by Dr Eddie O’Connor, formerly CEO and founder of global development company, Airtricity which was sold to Scottish and Southern Energy and E.ON for €1.8 billion. They have offices on five continents and employ over 180 colleagues in their markets. They are an independent global developer with a proven track record in delivering large-scale wind and solar power plant to the world’s emerging economies. Governments look at their unrivaled experience in high-growth energy markets like Chile and South Africa and know they are in safe hands. Their proven ability to put all the elements of development in place, from consent to construction to operation means they can rely on them to guarantee delivery. To safely and successfully unlock the sustainable energy sources that will transform their economies.
