Land swap involves the transfer of public land to private developers in exchange for an equal value land but far more suitable for development. In January, this year, 35 firms were shortlisted by the Housing and Urban Development Ministry. These firms will partner with the government in achieving the 1 million affordable homes target  at a cost of US 26bn. Some of these houses include a 55-acre piece of land in Mavoko at its pilot phase, Athi River and Kitengela housing projects and many more locations across the country. The Big Four Agenda also consists of growth of security, affordable healthcare and manufacturing.
