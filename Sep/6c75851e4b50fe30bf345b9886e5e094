The construction of 99 Botswana Housing Corporation (BHC) houses at Extension seven in Palapye is said to be behind schedule. Speaking during the ongoing sub-council meeting, Palapye Administrative Authority chairperson, Mr. Lesedi Phuthego said the US $1.4m project was 23% behind schedule due to the shortage of imported back-fill (G5 gravel). The project was to be complete by August 2019. Mr. Phuthego however said the contractor had since found another supplier and was stockpiling material on site.
