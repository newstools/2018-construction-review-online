The project was slowed down by who hurriedly pulled out their investment when the government changed (from Goodluck Jonathan to Muhammudu Buhara). He also called on civil servants, workers and other Nigerians with legitimate source of livelihood to latch on the golden opportunity of owning luxury and affordable houses that will soon spring up at the city. â€œThis is a great thing. It is entirely private sector-driven and zero government funding. I am a developer and I have buhari towers that I will build for sale. There will be a distinct tower of 336ft in height to house every former President. Each of them will have a floor to showcase their achievements. 10 floors have been earmarked for 5-star hotel and others for offices. The centenary city project was introduced by Goodluck Jonathan for 100 years celebration of Nigeria. The project will create 250,000 daily jobs and house 140,000 residents. It will also boost 260 luxury villas, 256 apartment building, 13 waterfront retail areas, 139 office buildings, 313,697 square meter hotel suites and serviced apartments, 30 floors of luxury apartments, among other offerings. The project will cost US $30m to design and will be handled by the same company that designed Abuja itself.
