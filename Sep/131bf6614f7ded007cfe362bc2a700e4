The mall will sit well on its prime retail pitch immediately between major employment zones — the CBD, the Industrial Area and Upper Hill — thus broadening the localized leisure offer to encourage longer dwell time at the mall by visiting families with children, teenagers and young people. This is aLL Design’s first project in Africa and the second shopping centre-led development for Kiloran LLP, who have offices in both London and Nairobi. The mixed use space will feature a shopping centre and Grade A office project. It will have 24,300 square metres of retail, food and beverage along with a 4,200 square metre, seven-storey office tower overlooking the mall’s roof garden and bar. The shopping mall according to the architecture will be completed in 2020.
