With the WVP 10, Kärcher has developed a new window vac to meet the requirements of commercial operators. The machine is a practical addition for manual cleaning, for example, of glass doors, mirrors, smooth tables, windows and tiles. With the WVP 10, dirty water remaining on surfaces after cleaning is vacuumed away – streak-free and without residues. This machine is used by building service contractors, in shops, public facilities, hotels and restaurants or at petrol stations. The window vac can be used with one hand. An advantage is the relatively low machine weight of 750g – similar to a tablet PC. The on/off switch on the outside of the handle can be operated conveniently with the thumb. The 200ml dirty water tank is designed for both horizontal and vertical use without dripping. After use, it is simply removed from the machine and washed with clear water or cleaned in a dishwasher. The battery run time with one charge is about 30 minutes, which is sufficient for an area of about 110m². An LED display above the on/off switch shows the remaining energy reserve. The battery can be changed for long periods of use with minimum or only short interruptions. The new model is available in two versions, the WVP 10 with one battery and a standard battery charger (185min charging time) and the Adv versions with two batteries and a 60-minute quick charger. This version features a second, narrower suction lip (170 mm), which is ideal for narrow surfaces such as windows with bars.
