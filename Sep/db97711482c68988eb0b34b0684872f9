South Africa through the Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has closed a section of the M2 Kaserne bridge following the reduced structural integrity of the concrete elements. JRA engineers realized that parts of the support structure have moved vertically and horizontally, affecting the structural stability of the bridge during their continuous monitoring at the M2 Kaserne bridge. About 200 m of the Kaserne section of the bridge will be closed off to traffic. However, traffic from the east-bound lanes will be diverted onto the west-bound lane to allow for traffic to flow in both directions. The JRA also reported that only about 6% of the 902 bridges managed by the city are considered to be in a good condition. The M2 Selby and Kaserne bridges’ total repair and rehabilitation works will start from the second week of October and should take about 12 months to complete.
