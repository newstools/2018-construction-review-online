 Sharp’s polycrystalline PV panels are particularly attractive for the African market due to their competitive price-performance ratio. In this segment Sharp can offer three different 60 cells panel types (ND-RK Series, ND-RB Series and ND-RJ Series) in either 270W / 275W or Sharp’s project 72 cells panel with 330W. All Sharp PV modules have a bankable 10 year product guarantee and a 25 year linear power output guarantee. This is further enhanced by the positive power tolerance, which offers up to 5% greater power output achievement than specified on the datasheet. The modules are also certified by leading international bodies and subject to a comprehensive Sharp testing procedure which is up to 5 times stricter than required by IEC. Barbara Rudek, Business Development Manager Africa comments “Africa has a great opportunity to support its rapid economic growth in a sustainable way, by building an environmentally friendly and reliable energy supply that will provide energy security for generations to come next to job creation.
