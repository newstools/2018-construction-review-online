We are calling for speedy investigation of the suspected arsonist,” said Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba . The mayor acknowledged the team that helped restore the power in record time despite the severe damage caused from the fire adding that the City Power was overwhelmed by the positive reactions from residents who applauded the efforts in their numbers on social media. He also informed the residents of a slight delay before the supply of water normalizes owing to the depletion of water in the reservoirs. “City Power investigators are still finalizing their probe. We are getting to the bottom of it. We will ensure there are proper remedial measures to ensure this doesn’t happen again. We assure you that water supply will be restored to everyone affected,” said the Mayor.
