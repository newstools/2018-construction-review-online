The Federal Government of Nigeria seeks US $6bn loan from the China Exim Bank for the construction of the Ibadan-Kano rail line project. Transport Minister Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, confirmed the statement and said the country required a total amount of US $8bn to do a double track however the Chinese insisted on a single track. “We are currently in negotiations with the China Exim Bank to get about US $6bn to do (rail lines) from Ibadan to Kano.They are asking us to do a single track and they want it at Minna so that instead of going from Minna to Kaduna, we should go from Minna to Abuja and then join it from Abuja to Kaduna,” said Rotimi Amaechi.

Given the country’s infrastructure deficit, which needs to be urgently addressed, the loans from China Exim, which provide financing for critical infrastructure in road and rail transport, aviation, water, agriculture and power at concessional terms, are appropriate for Nigeria’s financing needs and align properly with the country’s Debt Management Strategy,” added the DMO.
