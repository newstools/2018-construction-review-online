Seeing the project as an ideal opportunity to further advance the green energy revolution, while contributing to the development of local communities, Mr. Hobson explains that South Africa is transitioning towards a renewable future, which facilitates multiple opportunities for growth and development within areas and communities that have lacked infrastructure, investment and sustainable employment opportunities. The Perdekraal East wind farm will eliminate about 410 000 t/y of carbon emissions, compared with traditional fossil fuel power plants. In addition to zero carbon emissions and reduced use of fossil fuels, South Africa will benefit from minimal water consumption during the generation process and significant social and enterprise development programmes. The mega wind farm is owned by a number of equity members, which include Mainstream Renewable Power, along with a consortium of investors such as the International Finance Corporation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
