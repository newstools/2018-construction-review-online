Egypt’s Ministry of Electricity has penned a contract with Siemens to install two cells for the project in the Tushka plant. The project of electricity interconnection with Sudan is part of Egypt’s plan to become a regional energy hub and exchange electricity with Arab, African, and European countries after a surplus in production of up to 15,000 MW. Officials from the ministry have taken ambassadors of Siemens and Energy-iBB to Sudan to examine the Sudanese electric grid and the connection points in order to implement effective power compensatory transformers, one of the basics in the connection project in order to maintain the stability of the network and the electrical efforts in addition to preventing any falls in capacity.
