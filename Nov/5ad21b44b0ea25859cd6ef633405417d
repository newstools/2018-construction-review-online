The government of Kenya through Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (KETRACO), has began plans to electrify US $3bn Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). KETRACO said they have sought environmental approval from National Environment Management Authority (Nema) to start construction of 12 transmission lines and 14 substations along the SGR line.

This will create more major power customers and consumers and bring other opportunities to the locals,” said KETRACO. Kenya had earlier signed a deal with China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Company Limited (CET) to provide funds needed for the electrification that is estimated to cost US $240m. Nema also said that it was already collecting views regarding the multi-billion project that could see Kenya join the league of African countries like Ethiopia and Egypt which already have electric railway. The move to electrify the rail however, comes at a time when Kenya Railways is need of more revenues to support the mega project that was built on debt. Cargo charges on the standard gauge railway (SGR) from Mombasa to Nairobi will rise by up to 79% from January 1 in bid to raise more revenue to pay the Chinese operator.
