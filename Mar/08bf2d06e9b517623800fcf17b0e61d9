Underserved communities and businesses in rural Kenya are soon going to access the energy they need to improve their lives and boost their economy. Renewvia Energy, a solar energy solutions provider is helping achieve this milestone. Renewvia conducted a year-long solar microgrid feasibility study in 2017, talking to all stakeholders and community members at length about their needs and concerns. According to Trey Jarrard, CEO of Renewvia, the solar feasibility studies provided the company specific and unique insight which are unobtainable in any commercial manner.

In January 2018, the company began construction of three sites in the East African country and plans to complete an additional ten sites this year. Through this project, Renewvia seeks to connect around 4,000 homes and businesses in 2018. The sites are in multiple counties from Lake Victoria all the way to the Indian Ocean. The renewable company has also partnered with both the U.S. Trade and Development Agency’s (USTDA) Power Africa initiative and community and government agencies in Kenya to drive the scheme. Pam Onyanyo, director of Sub-Saharan Africa for Renewvia, applauded the role of the USTDA. “The contribution from the USTDA at the onset of this development effort was critical and we are thankful for this partnership,” she said. Furthermore, it expedited the development of a financeable investment-grade product that will yield returns for both Kenyans and U.S. solar product manufacturers.
