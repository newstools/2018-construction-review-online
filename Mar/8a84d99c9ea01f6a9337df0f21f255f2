The Minister for Infrastructure, James Musoni and Clare Akamanzi, the chief executive officer for the Rwanda Development Board, represented government at the signing ceremony.

Furthermore, public-private partnership is important. The International Solar Alliance’s proposed tools to mitigate credit risk sent an important signal to the market, that solar energy is a viable business. In April 2016, ISA proposed a common guarantee fund and guarantee investments with a clear scope, definition of risk coverage and recourse options. This intended to reduce transaction costs to mobilize the investment volumes necessary for scaling up solar energy projects. ISA proposed setting up a US $300bn Global Solar Fund over 10 years with contributions from the World Bank, Overseas Development Assurances and from the Green Climate Fund to leverage US $300bn in investment from the corporate sector. Recently, more joint financial partnership were achieved by various financiers for mobilizing funds for the deployment of over 1,000GW of solar energy.
