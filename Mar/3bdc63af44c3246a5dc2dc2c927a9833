Transport has resumed on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway following repairs made on the Athi River bridge. The bridge was washed away by heavy rains being experienced in the country. Similarly, the main bridge at the Kangundo-Kamulu road also went down. However, the bridge has been repaired as well according to the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) which had diverted motorists following floods in the area. According to KeNHA upon the closure of the highway, the bridge was temporarily inaccessible due to safety reasons. “However, the situation is under constant monitoring and the public will be advised promptly on upcoming developments. Meanwhile, the authority advise motorist to take an alternative route which is Konza-Katumani-Machakos-Roma-Ruai-Cabanas,” said KeNHA.

However, traffic police officers have been deployed to the main junctions in the affected areas to control traffic and restore normalcy. “While the bridge has now been re-opened to traffic, road users are requested to exercise care and strictly follow traffic control instructions from the officers on site,” said Charles Njogu, KeNHA’s Assistant Director in charge of Corporate Communication. Mr. Njogu further warned that, further disruptions may be necessary as part of the reinstatement process. Patience and cooperation is requested should this occur. According to KeNHA water levels at the Stoni Athi Bridge between Athi River and Kyumvi have reduced to safe levels, hence repairs to erosion-damaged approaches will continue.
