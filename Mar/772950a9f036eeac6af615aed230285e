The refurbishment works being done at the Nyayo National Stadium, Kasarani Stadium and the Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Kenya will be completed in the next 60 days; this is according to Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa.

The stadiums have been under renovation since 2017 but the slowness of construction works cost the country dearly after Kenya was denied rights to host the African Nations Championship (CHAN) early this year by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Morocco was eventually chosen to replace Kenya and host the games. Confederation of African football cited lack of preparedness on the part of Kenya as their reason for moving the biennial tournament set aside for local based players only. The fifth edition of the continental tournament took place between 11 January and 2 February 2018. Also, the renovations have led to the Kenyan Premier League matches to be played on some sub-standard surfaces such as the Ruaraka grounds hence inconveniencing the players and football fans.
