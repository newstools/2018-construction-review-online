The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) has been fined a whopping US $70m by a Chinese firm- China Jiangxi, the contractor for the stalled 39-storey building in Nairobi that housed Nakumatt Lifestyle. The Chinese firm was contracted by NSSF to finish building the tower, which by then had eight floors, including the four that accommodated the supermarket, between June 2013 and July 2016, but work however stopped on the 15th floor.

Nakumatt had initially blocked NSSF contractors from reinforcing columns inside the store for additional floors. The Auditor-General Edward Ouko last year recommended legal action taken against Nakumatt to end the blockade. Unfortunately, the retail chain was evicted from the building in December for failure to pay rent, paving the way for resumption of construction. China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation (CJIC or called Jiangxi International) is a Chinese construction and engineering company operating in many countries of Anglophone Africa. The firm won top grade contracting qualifications in building projects, water conservancy and hydroelectric projects; road and bridge projects in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ghana and Zambia.
