Construction of Terminal Three at the Julius Nyerere Airport (JNIA) in Tanzania is almost complete. This is according to Engineers Registration Board (ERB) Vice-Chairperson, Ms Gemma Modu. Ms Modu further clarified that the project is 70% complete with total completion of the project expected in May 2019. Initially, the project had been planned for commissioning in December this year, but challenges to do with importation of quality construction material led to the opening date being pushed to later next year. “The time of project completion has extended due to various challenges including availability of quality construction materials which are bought from abroad. It takes time for the materials to arrive in the country. Time of shifting from one phase to another also affected the project,” said Ms Gemma Modu.
