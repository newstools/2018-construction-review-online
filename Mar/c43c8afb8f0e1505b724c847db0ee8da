A US $16m shopping mall is set to be constructed in Nakuru town, Kenya by the Egerton University Retirement Benefits Scheme. This initiative will allow them to meet the growing demand for quality commercial space. Egerton University Vice Chancellor Prof Rose Mwonya confirmed the reports and said that the mega project dubbed Golden Life Mall will probably be completed within two years once construction commences. Also, confirming the news was Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui, who recently presided over the ground breaking ceremony. He said that the development is significant as Nakuru County seeks to acquire city status.

The shopping mall which will be located along the busy Nakuru highway will be a landmark building that will improve income flow for the university’s scheme. Additionally, on a mission to de-congest the town, ample parking and enough office space will be catered for. The county boss challenged pension schemes in the devolved unit to invest more in housing referring to the high demand for affordable homes that could provide much needed revenue streams for the funds. Currently, Nakuru County has a number of shopping malls that are already in operation. They include Naivas super centre Mall, Rivanas Arena, Tapoos Complex, Westside Mall and Imani Shopping Mall among others. Westside Mall is considered to be the largest and most prestigious mall in the town. It is also considered as an ultra-modern commercial center.
