The Federal Government of Nigeria reveals plans to demolish more structures to give way for full internationalization of Akanu Ibiam Airport in Enugu. This is according to Mr. Hadi Sirika, Minister of State for Aviation. According to Mr. Sirika, the Federal Government has already released US $4.7m for the construction work to continue at the international wing of the airport. Moreover, more money will be made available when the 2018 budgetary provision is released for the completion of work. The Government has decided to expand the runway from 2.5 km to 3 km to accommodate more international flights and cargoes. The runway project plans had to be stopped midway because people have built within 100m on the runway. “The Orie Emene market is a security threat. There is an abattoir in the market that attracts vultures which portends danger to flights. There is a road leading the Very High Frequency Omni -Directional Radio Range, VOR, which is in terrible state,” said Hadi Sirika. “It functions 24 hours because it guides pilots in their flights. Without this, this airport cannot be operated. The road is 1.5km and we need to build it because it is impassible during the rainy season,” he added.
