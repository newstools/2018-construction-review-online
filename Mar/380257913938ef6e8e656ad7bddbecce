Also, the east wing of the tower will have 30 floors while the other will have 16 floors. “The project is in Westlands where the intention is to build commercial and retail real estate with two towers, one of 16 floors and another of 30 floors with three floors of retail space. This will kick off in the second half of 2018,” said Ms Okinda. Also, Zamara Executive Director James Olubayi confirmed the news and said the move was aimed at utilising part of their 128 acres of land in Nairobi, and Kisaju and Kipeto in Kajiado County, for the benefit of their member retirement schemes which bring together 33,000 members. “Our first strategy was to build a residential estate of 211 housing units worth US$ 27m and a mall worth US$ 4m at our 30 acre property in Kitengela but we have now settled on purchasing a commercial building with tenants so as to boost earnings for our members,” said Mr Olubayi.
