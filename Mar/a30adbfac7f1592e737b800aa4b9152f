The construction of a US$ 30m up market apartment hotel in South Africa is almost complete. It is currently on its final stages of development. Dubbed the Regency, it was initially supposed to open its doors in 2016 but delays in construction were experienced due to the slow process in acquiring the proper zoning permits. Developer Key Spirit Development CEO Rodney Wolmer confirmed the news and said that the hotel which is situated in the heart of Pretoria’s Menlyn node area acquired the permits and is now on track for its June 1, 2018 opening.

Each luxury apartment in the hotel development is fitted with top quality finishes, including energy saving appliances by Miele, centralized air-conditioning, a restaurant, bar, bespoke gym, high-end security with 24-hour surveillance and ample underground parking. Architectural firm Archactive International designed the state-of-the-art hotel while Key Spirit Development was behind its development. The companies had a specific intention of catering to the needs and requirements of local and international professionals such as diplomats and investors. 85% of its apartments have already been sold out.
