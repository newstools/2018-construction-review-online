The Energy Commission of Nigeria has foreseen a growth of up to 100,000MW electricity generation in the country by 2030. According to Eli Bala, the ECN’s Director-General, the projection would be possible with an annual economic growth rate of 7% as well as a steady implementation of the national energy plan. The Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing is to oversee this implementation. With the increased power programme; every time, every year, there must be an increase in power generation.

Mr. Bala, who said the legal mandate of the commission is to produce strategic plans and coordinate national policies, also stressed that for one to have something, one must plan for it. According to Bala, from the strategic plans drawn, there is an energy master plan particularly with respect to electricity generation. Nigeria was the first to articulate the various energy mix including renewable and also nuclear. “From the plans made, if the economy is to grow at 7%, we need nothing less than 100GW of electricity capacity,” he added. Furthermore, Nigerian politicians want the economy to grow by double digit. If the economy is to grow by double digits, the country will need nothing less than 300GW by 2030.
