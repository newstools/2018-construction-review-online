Delta State Governor Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa has revealed that commercial activities will be in full swing at the Asaba International Airport by July, this year. Speaking during an inspection visit to the airport, the Governor expressed joy that the contractor handling the reconstruction of the runway, Setraco has proven the possibility of the project being delivered within three months. “It took two years for ULO to construct 900m of the runway, but it brings joy to my heart that in just three weeks, Setraco have done 1.1 km of the runway,” commended Governor Okowa. Asaba Airport serves Asaba, the capital of Delta State of Nigeria. It also serves Onitsha, across the Niger River in Anambra State. The airport was initially opened with great expectations in 2013, but rapid deterioration of the new runway has required major restoration.
