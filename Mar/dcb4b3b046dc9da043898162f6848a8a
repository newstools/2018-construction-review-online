Chitungwiza Municipality has embarked on a US $500 000 road maintenance programme that includes resurfacing and pothole patching on the main roads in the dormitory town. Most of the town’s roads have become unusable and a danger to vehicles after normal rainfall that was experienced in Zimbabwe this year. The government early this year declared all roads ‘A National Disaster’ and set up an emergency US $100m fund for road repairs and maintenance. Other roads that will be maintained in the project include the one linking Makoni shopping centre to Chibuku Stadium and the road starting from the Wilmur Surface oil refinery plant to Seke.
