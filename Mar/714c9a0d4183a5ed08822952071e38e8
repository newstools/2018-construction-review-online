Decent low-cost houses are set to be constructed in at least 26 slums in Nairobi, Kenya. Sanitation and security are among other things that will be implemented in the slums. Private investors in conjunction with the Nairobi County government will come together in order to make the multi-billion shilling Urban Regeneration of Informal Settlements programme a reality.

The programme will eventually improve the living standards of the residents through better planning, housing tenure, better infrastructure, amenities, business opportunities, among other improvements. Additionally, it will help achieve Kenya’s Vision 2030 and the County’s Integrated Development Plan 2018-2022. Interested parties are invited to submit their letters, innovative designs and proposals for redevelopment by April 5. Successful investors will be required to mobilize finances, technology and managerial expertise to roll out the programme. Kibera, which accommodates approximately 250,000 people, is the biggest slum in East Africa and one of the biggest in Africa. About 2.5 million people live in more than 200 informal settlements, representing more than 60% of the capital’s population.
