Within its growing East African base, sought after global bathroom and kitchen manufacturer Kohler set down roots in Nairobi, Kenya a year ago by joining in partnership with Kitchens & Beyond. Having cultivated a loyal following among the architecture and design industry there, the multi award winning brand has become the chosen supplier for bathroom and kitchen fixtures and fittings. Tapping into their ongoing passion for the arts, Kohler and Kitchens & Beyond kicked off the year with an event held at Nairobi’s swish Capital Club. The event, called Kohler.Bold.Art, is one of a number hosted in key cities globally and was the first to be held in East Africa, with future art and craft inspired events planned for the region. The Nairobi chapter of Kohler.Bold.Art focused on elevating talented Kenyan artists and musicians, bringing prominent business people and design leaders together whilst enjoying the sultry sounds of Nairobi’s finest live music act, the Blue Motion Band. With the best of the industry in attendance, Kohler released two of their newest products to the market in a thoughtfully curated installation. As the name suggests, the Modern Life collection introduces the latest in hygiene technology, with a host of bathroom fixtures and fittings whose form and finishes make cleanliness an art form- ideal for the hotel industry. Kohler also released their all new Brushed Nickel range of taps and mixers, whose warmth and subtlety are a classic addition to the bathroom and kitchen. The new ranges are showcased at Kitchens and Beyond in the Ukay Centre, Westlands, Nairobi. As Kohler’s Kenyan partner, they look forward to the coming year as the local market has received the brand with zest.
