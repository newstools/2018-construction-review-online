The Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) is currently boasting of enough electricity power supply within Kilimanjaro; the region has been described as ‘good enough’ to meet the requirements of new industrial investments in the country. This was announced by the Tanesco Regional Manager Eng Mahawa Mkaka, after visiting the company’s power supply stations. “We can now generate some 135 MW of electricity for use in Kilimanjaro region, our demands so far stands at just 34 MW.
