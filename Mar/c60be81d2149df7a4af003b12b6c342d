This plan covers a spectrum of issues including site selection, grid and bankable data to power sales, financing, procurement policies as well as operation and maintenance. According to the minister of Water, Irrigation and Electricity Seleshi Bekele, the government is initiating a series of actions towards transforming the power sector regulatory framework to involve private sector.

Upgrading institutional arrangements in line with the Public-Private Partnership law will enable speedy and efficient delivery process to meet the ever-growing demand for electricity of the country. According to Bekele, wind power in the diversified energy mix will contribute to protect against frequent droughts due to climate change that pose a strategic threat to hydropower, which will continue to be the power system backbone for years to come. Danish Ambassador to Ethiopia, Mette Thygesen said the plan will enable the mobilization of much needed private investments. It is aimed at providing an up-to-date, logically organized framework for prioritizing initiatives and procedures for developing and scaling up wind power in Ethiopia. Thygesen noted that modern wind power is a cost-effective energy source that can be installed in a short time-frame.
