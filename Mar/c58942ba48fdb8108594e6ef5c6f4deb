The construction of an RDP housing project in South Africa is now complete, thanks to Raubex Group Ltd which was behind the project. The company managed to construct 480 units at Riverside View south of Diepsloot in the Fourways area near Johannesburg which cost them a whopping US $6.3m. It was implemented for developer Valumax – beginning in June 2016 and ran through to October 2017. Raubex contract manager, Jacques Vermaak confirmed the reports and said that the smooth process of construction was a testimony to the strong teamwork among all stakeholders. “Everyone played their part with great pride, striving for the highest quality in everything we did; this was a recipe for a rapid rate of production, with enviable standards that must rate among the best in any RDP construction project,” says Vermaak. Additionally, he added that they were required to construct 15 four storey buildings at the location, with 32 units per building and these were the first four-storey buildings developed for RDP housing in Johannesburg making it a flagship plan for future multi-storey RDP units. The company has also built on a number of previous projects for Valumax, including RDP multi-storeys (two floors) and gap houses in Clayville, Midrand, as well as gap houses at the Riverside View site. Raubex is a world-class company focusing on the heavy construction sector; with a deep focus on infrastructure development operating across Africa. In the mid-1990’s, it started expanding on its African footprint and secured various projects in Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. Today Raubex generates approximately 10% of its revenue outside of South Africa.
