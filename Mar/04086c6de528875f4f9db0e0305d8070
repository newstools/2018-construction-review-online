The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has repaired 44 350 potholes across the city since the beginning of the 2017/18 financial year. The city currently has a backlog of US $1bn for upgrading the city’s 13 599 km road network, of which US $608.1m is required for repairs to surfaced roads and US $402.6m for the upgrade of gravel roads to tar. “City-wide, the JRA is faced with a US $7bn ten-year backlog to address the city’s ageing road infrastructure. Based on the 2017 JRA roads conditions study, we are faced with a 25% increase in the deterioration of the road network condition, from 89% to 64%. The excessive damage to our road network has resulted in a rise in pothole reports and increased safety concerns,”  said Transport MMC Nonhlanhla Makhuba. The JRA noted that it continues to prioritize pothole repairs, with US $7.5m allocated towards fast-tracking repairs and priority roads scheduled for upgrades. Since July 2017, 520km of roads have been resurfaced, 32.26km upgraded from gravel roads to surfaced roads and a total 300m of open storm water drains have been converted to underground systems.

The new plant will improve efficiency and produce hot and cold tar mix through improved environment-friendly processes. It will also increase the supply of asphalt for pothole repairs and road surfacing to JRA’s road surfacing depot and seven regional depots. The JRA said US $20.6m has been allocated towards resurfacing and reconstruction. The allocation is split with US $12m for resurfacing and US $8.6m for reconstruction. A further US $25.3m has been allocated towards the upgrading of gravel roads. “At present, 32% of surfaced roads, which make up 3 968km require reconstruction, 45% of surfaced roads, which make up 5 581km, is in very good and good condition and 23% of surfaced roads, which make up 2 852km, require resurfacing,” said Makhuba.
