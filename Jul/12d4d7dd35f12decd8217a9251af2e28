Emergency power is set to be supplied to hotels in Burkina Faso; this is after HIMOINSA confirmed that it will supply HYW-35 T5 generator sets, which generate standby power of 37 Kva to guarantee the electricity supply of HOTÊL POKO, located to the west of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso.

In this case, the HYW-35 T5 model with a Yanmar engine and a STAMFORD alternator was chosen. In the event of a power outage, the generator will start up to supply power to the whole hotel complex and enable both the main building and the outside area to function as normal. The soundproofed generator set guarantees low noise emissions, which is ideal for urban centres and a feature that was very much appreciated by the customer. The generator set incorporates a 100L internal tank, meaning that the generator’s running time is long enough that no external tank is required, thus reducing operation costs. HIMOINSA offers optional larger tanks, with a capacity of 190 and 330 litres, where required.
