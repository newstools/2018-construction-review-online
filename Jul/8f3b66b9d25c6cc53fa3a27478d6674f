Kinshofer has unveiled a new orange peel grapples which are designed to reduce damage to the device’s hoses and other components and to increase the amount of material that can be grabbed. Kinshofer’s new P-Series orange peel grapples grab more debris, better protect components. The grapples are attached to excavators of 16 to 88 tons and loader cranes and can hold 4 cubic yards of material for scrap, demolition, loading and unloading tasks. Options include three, four or five times. Four tine profiles are available: fully closing, half closing, pointed and wide-style pointed. The tines have a slim design to help them penetrate scrap and demolition piles. The grapple’s hydraulic cylinders have replaceable piston rod protection that is hydraulically cushioned. Removable covers provide quick access to hoses, oil and grease points. A heavy-duty slewing ring allows for 360-degree continuous rotation and ensures optimum force during operation, the company says. The non-return valve, located directly under the rotation device, retains the grapple’s load to increase safety during unintended pressure drops. The tine heads and main bearing are widely spaced to reduce the face pressure in the bushings, as well as absorb distortion if the grab is overloaded. The induction-hardened pins are seated in steel bushings, and the lateral thrust discs provide a solid support for the tines and also reduce wear, according to the company.
