The ongoing construction of four footbridges along Thika Highway is set to be completed by December this year.This is according to Charles Njogu Assistant Director for communication at the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA). Upon completion of the footbridges which will cost US $8.2m, KeNHA will remove all safety bumps installed in the 4 locations to speed up traffic flow as well as enhance safety of pedestrians. Interways Works Limited have been contracted to install the Witeithie and Mangu footbridges at a cost of US $4.3m, while Four way Construction Limited will erect the Garden City and Survey of Kenya footbridges at a cost of US $3.9m. The construction of the bridges started in May.

Thika Road is fitted with 18 footbridges, with 10 more designed but yet to be erected due to lack of funds. KeNHA is considering floating an infrastructure bond through public private partnerships (PPPs) and concessions of targeted roads as a means to check infrastructure costs. Currently transport cost accounts for around 30% of the cost of goods and services across the region due to poor infrastructure and the thousands of man-hours lost in traffic on a daily basis. “These projects will not only greatly cut down costs for motorists in terms of fuel savings, lost man hours and car maintenance costs, but will also be expected to greatly spur economic activity along the corridors they pass, in a similar fashion to what Nairobi-Thika Road has done” said Infrastructure Principal Secretary Eng. John Mosonik. KeNHA is a leading Highways Authority committed to quality, safe and adequate National Trunk Roads. Their mandate is to manage, develop, rehabilitate and maintain national roads.
