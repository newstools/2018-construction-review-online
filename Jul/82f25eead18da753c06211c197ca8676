South Korea has vowed to support Kenya’s affordable housing agenda alongside other initiatives which include energy, agriculture and healthcare; this is after the Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon visited the country and expressed interest.

The Big Four initiative will see 500,000 homes developed in the next five years.

Nairobi and Seoul already have cooperation agreements in agriculture and fisheries, energy and infrastructure, along with healthcare and is yet to add housing. “We’re keen to provide affordable housing support to Kenya if the government wants us to,” the PM confirmed the reports during the Korea-Kenya Business Forum that seeks to spur more Korean startups to make entry into East Africa. To boost the idea, Kenya will also receive a whooping US $2bn grant from the United Nations between 2018 and 2022 for the ‘Big Four’ development agenda; this is after Treasury secretary, Mr. Henry Rotich signed the agreement for the UN’s Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)
