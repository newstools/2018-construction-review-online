Empire Crane Company  has sold a brand new 2018 Manitex 2892C to Accurate Crane Service in Wallingford, CT. The 28 ton boom truck is mounted on a Peterbuilt 348 truck and features out & down outriggers, a 92’ boom, single stage jib, and a Greer LMI. “I chose the Manitex 2892C because it is a little bit smaller and will fit my niche and customer needs better than our other cranes. It is going to be a lot more versatile. I really enjoyed working with Manitex and the Empire team because of the accommodations they made to help him customize the machine,” said Steve Bishop, owner and operator of Accurate says. “Accurate first purchased from Empire 12 years ago and is now trading in that purchase. Over the years i have worked with Jonelle Alberici in our parts department for any parts needed. I really enjoy working with Jonelle because she has all of my cranes on file, can tell me the specific part numbers I need and the parts at my door within two days. That’s really a priority for me,” he added.
