We will double our funds to implement the project to spur economic development across the country,” said the President of AfDB, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina. Cabinet Secretary for Energy Charles Keter also added that the funding will support the government’s objective for universal connectivity by 2020. Dr Adesina and Keter were speaking in Rongai, Nakuru County, during the launch of the second phase of the project. “The project will improve the livelihoods of all Kenyans, especially for those living in low income areas because the government has subsidized the cost of facilitating an electricity connection,” said Mr Keter. The Last Mile Connectivity project has jointly funding from the Government of Kenya, the AfDB and the World Bank. Since its implementation in May 2015, electricity access in Nakuru County has increased by 45% and over one million customers have access to electricity in the county.
