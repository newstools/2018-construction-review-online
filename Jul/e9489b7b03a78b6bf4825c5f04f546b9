Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos Nigeria will be shut to traffic at midnight on Thursday July 26 and reopened at midnight of Sunday July 29 this year to pave way for engineers conduct assessment tests on some sections of the bridge. The Federal Controller of Works, Lagos, Adedamola Kuti, explained that if vehicles were allowed on the bridge during the tests, the movement will alter the readings expected from the tests. Mr. Kuti said the results of the tests will enable them to determine how to embark on actual repair work, adding that details of alternative routes would be provided to members of the public tomorrow after a stakeholders’ meeting in the afternoon tomorrow.
