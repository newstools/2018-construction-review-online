The construction of Tedzani 1V Power Plant is expected to add 19.5MW to the national generation system which currently produces 351MW, thereby reducing frequent blackouts. Minister of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining Aggrey Masi has challenged Mitsubishi Corporation, a contractor for the construction of Tedzani 1V Electricity Power Plant to utilize local workforce in the project. The project, whose sole owner is Electricity Generation Company Limited (EGENCO), started on June 11, 2018 and is expected to run for 39 months.

This will mean that there will be job opportunities for the communities and their income would uplift their lives,” he said. Masi then urged the communities to work hard and also with diligence once employed at the construction site for the success of the project. In his remarks, Mitsubishi Corporation General Manager, Yusuke Mosodo said his company had already started employing locals and that there was hope that the figures would rise depending on stages of the project. “We understand the need to engage the local workforce and currently we have close to 60 local people from the communities excluding the expatriates,” he said.
