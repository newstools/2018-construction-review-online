A statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to FCT Minister, Cosmas Uzodinma, stated that the 45.245 km standard gauge rail line from Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport to the Abuja Metro Station is the first of its kind in West Africa. According to the statement, the project had been in the works for over 11 years. Mr Cosmas added that the commissioning will mark formal commencement of rail service and the fulfillment of a long-awaited dream for a modern state-of-the-art mass transit system for the FCT.
