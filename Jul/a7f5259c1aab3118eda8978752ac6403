SKF announced the introduction of its Lincoln small grease reservoir filling filter. Part of SKF’s family of filtration products, this filter helps to minimize contaminants entering automatic lubrication systems during the filling process of smaller-sized reservoirs. Installed as an inline component in the reservoir’s fill line, the filling filter helps to ensure that clean grease enters the reservoir and the system. As grease enters through the inlet, it passes through the filter and then exits into a hose that is connected to the grease reservoir’s fill port. As the filter element becomes clogged, the unit’s clogged-indicator pin starts to retract, signaling that filter element cleaning is required. If the clogged filter element is not cleaned, grease will vent safely to a catch container but will not bypass to the reservoir. The easy-to-install Lincoln small grease reservoir filling filter is available with either a 250- or 500-micron, crush-proof filter element, which is simple to clean. It has a fill rate of up to 8 liters/min (2 gal/min)* and operating pressure of 344 bar (5,000 psi). The filter’s compact size makes remote mounting from the reservoir possible. The Lincoln small grease reservoir filling filter is suitable for off-road construction, small mining equipment, general industry, wind energy, over-the-road trucking, construction and agricultural applications. Combining more than 100 years of SKF and Lincoln expertise, SKF offers the industry’s most complete portfolio of innovative lubrication solutions from manual lubricators and tools, to the most advanced centralized and automatic lubrication systems.
