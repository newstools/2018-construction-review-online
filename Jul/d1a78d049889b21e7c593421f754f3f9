According to the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa’s electricity deficit has begun to close for the first time. “We have made great strides in bringing electricity to the millions of people who need it most, under challenging conditions. But there is no time to rest. A billion people still don’t have electricity today. We are committed to helping countries scale up successful approaches to rapidly extend electricity services to all of their citizens,” said Riccardo Puliti, senior director and head of the energy and extractives global practice at the World Bank.
