Construction of the largest waste water treatment plant in Uganda is substantially complete with 95% of the civil and electro-mechanical works finalized in the Bugolobi Nakivubo catchment area in Kampala. National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC)’s Managing Director, Mr Silver Mugisha confirmed the reports and said that the new water treatment plant will be ready within three to four months.

Additionally, it will help clean Kampala city by diverting and treating waste water from the heavily polluted Nakivubo channel before releasing water into the Lake Victoria. Chemical processes have reportedly been introduced in the treatment stages to help reduce algae and eventually improve the quality of water on Lake Victoria. “The new plant uses a nuisance free technology and bio-filters and will not smell. It will serve the needs of 850,000 people,” he said The mega project encompasses an ultra-modern sewerage treatment plant in Bugolobi, a sewerage pre-treatment plant in Kinawataka, a sewerage pumping station on Kibira road and 31km of sewer network. The project is being funded by the government with support of the African Development Bank, the European Union and the German funding through KfW. Plans are also underway to construct a sewerage treatment plant in Nalukolongo and Kajjansi to serve the growing needs of Kampala city.
