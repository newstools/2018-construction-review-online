S. headquarters in Des Moines in 2017, Netherlands-based compact equipment maker Tobroco-Giant has added 17 North American dealers, says Toine Brock, company owner and director. “In our first year, we sold 150 machines, and were profitable,” he says. “Our plan is to start manufacturing in the United States once we start selling more than 500 units a year.” he added.
