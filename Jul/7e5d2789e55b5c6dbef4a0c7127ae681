Kenya’s Geothermal Development Company (GDC) is set to commence with the operation of drilling wells in search of steam power for the Baringo-Silali geothermal power project in Baringo County. George Kinyanjui, GDC general manager in-charge of drilling and infrastructure, confirmed the statement and said they have identified Paka, Silale and Korossi as prospect areas with each expected to generate more than 100MW. Kinyanjui further added that the first phase of the geothermal project at Baringo-Silali Block is expected to produce steam that can generate 300MW of electricity that will be injected into the national grid.

We have also managed to open the road network to the project area and so far we completed more than 120 Km. We’ve already put in place drilling wells, three in each of the prospect areas. Drilling works will commence once the water system is complete,” said Kinyanjui. GDC has already installed community distribution systems and nine storage tanks; each has a capacity of 4.5 million litres. The eco-project will also see carbon credit valued at over US $28.9 m being produced with the power generated helping light up Turkana oilfields. Mr.Kinyanjui pointed out that 15% of the total revenue generated annually from the project, will be channeled to benefit the communities surrounding the resource areas. He added that the power company is planning to pump water from Lake Baringo to Paka, which will open the door for drilling to commence in August.
