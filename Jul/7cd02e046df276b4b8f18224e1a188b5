Tanzania is set to begin construction of the 6.2 km Selander bridge in Dar es Salaam following signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Tanzania and South Korea. The MOU which was signed in the presence of President John Magufuli and the visiting South Korea Premier, Mr Lee Nak-yeon, will see construction costs of the bridge at US $126.26m and is expected to be completed by 2021. The new edifice will run from Selander bridge and along the Indian Ocean beach front in the city. The 180-tonnage capacity bridge will ferry 55,000 vehicles per day and is expected to greatly reduce congestion along the overwhelmed independence-time Selander bridge.
