What happened was that the contract was awarded earlier to a company that failed and now Setraco has taken over while the contract of the other contractor has been rescinded,” he said. Mohammed also added that besides the memorandum on the link bridge that was approved by FEC, the council has also re-awarded Oji- Achi- Mmaku- Awgu- Ndeabor road in Enugu State at a cost of US $32.3 m.
