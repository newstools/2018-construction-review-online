A new hospital is set for construction in Embakasi, Nairobi County by a private developer who is currently seeking permission for the commencement of the project  at a cost of US $4m. Regulatory filings by Acme Properties Ltd showed the four-floor hospital will incorporate male and female wards as well as provide other amenities for the well-being of patients. Acme’s Environmental Impact Assessment audit report said the investment will include dialysis, labour, chemo units as well as pediatric, ICU, HDU and NICU wards, endoscopy and dialysis departments.

The proponents urged the National Environmental Management Authority (Nema) to approve it saying it will generate employment, revenue as well as help improve the health of locals. Nema has sought public comments on the project in the next 30 days before it makes a decision on whether the project should be allowed or blocked. The lead consultant said the facility will also provide accommodation for medical staff thereby ensuring the facility has access to highly skilled medical personnel at all times. “It will improve capacity for provision of specialised health care services as well as support training and capacity building at the proposed centers of excellence,” he said.
