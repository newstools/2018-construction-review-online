The Employment and Labour relations Court has temporarily suspended the implementation of the proposed Housing Development fund levy pending the hearing and determination of a case filed by the Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU). COTU contested the implementation of the 1.5% mandatory levy on every worker’s gross salary, arguing that it is unconstitutional and it amounts to double taxation.
