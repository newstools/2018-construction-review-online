Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari approves dualisation of a major road linking Ikot Ekpene in Akwa Ibom State and Aba in Abia state. According to Senator Ita Enang, an aide to Muhammadu Buhari, the entire people of the south south have declared their support for President Buhari ahead of 2019. “Two things the president has done for us today; approving that the road between Ikot Ekpene in Akwa Ibom state and Aba in Abia state be dualised. “The second is that the road from Oron to Calabar, that is the 5th section of the East-West road is going to be awarded and completed; and that is under the Forum on China-African cooperation funding window,” said Senator Enang. “It runs into hundreds of billions; and runs through the sea and it is to link the entire south south. With these two and all others which have been awarded, the entire people of Akwa Ibom state and south south have declared that they will support the government of president Buhari and APC. We have no doubt that the entirety of south south and south east will be collapsing into APC led by Akwa Ibom,” he added.
