Early in 2010 a group of guys came together sharing a deep belief that UAV’s (unmanned aerial vehicles) would fundamentally change society in much the same way as the car or personal computer did. Since then we have been developing, testing and delivering high end aerial systems that are easy to use. These systems are specifically aimed at a variety of relevant Southern African challenges. Their systems can be used for Surveying, SWAT, Anti-Poaching, Crop Science, Live Stock Control, Fire Fighting, Search & Rescue (SAR), Mapping, Real Estate Photography, Disaster Site Monitoring & Mapping, Solar Panels, Agriculture, Forestry Management, Crime Situational Awareness, Illegal Immigrant Control, Coastal Surveillance, Emergency communications network–the list goes on! Integrity, quality and safety are the key pillars that EasyUAV have based our business on. They have a strong belief that personal / commercial UAV’s (Drones) have a massive role to play in society. EasyUAV supplies this game-changing technology within South Africa and neighboring countries.
