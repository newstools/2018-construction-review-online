The auditing arms of the central government and the county assembly will oversee the project to completion,” said Mr. Kimemia. US $436,000 has already been paid for a feasibility study on the plan. The Governor said that  county’s technical teams are on the ground identifying the towns to host the projects, saying they will be based on improving the urbanization index that currently stands at about 20%. Once the houses are set up, it’s estimated at least 10,000 people will benefit from the project. The units will be built in strategic towns and importance will be given based on the economic viability of the area. Construction of these units is set to begin by 2019. OL Kalou will benefit the most because its center of the county’s administration. It will also house most county employees due to the fact that most of the county staff are currently live in neighboring counties.
