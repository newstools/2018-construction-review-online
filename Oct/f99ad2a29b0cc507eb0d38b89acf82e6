Freda Prempeh, the deputy Works and Housing Minister said the ministry is in talks with some banks and financial institutions with the aim of providing mortgaging facilities to the beneficiaries. The 100,000 social housing units is expected to be completed in the next three years. Similar social housing has already been put up in South Africa, India, Singapore, Turkey, Israel and Kenya. Ms. Prempeh added that her ministry wants to incorporate new technologies into the housing industry and move away from the traditional building methods.
