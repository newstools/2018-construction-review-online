The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has completed and energized a new 330/132kV transmission substation in Damaturu, Yobe State. 12 years after a local contractor handling it failed to deliver. TCN’s General Manager, Public Affairs, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah confirmed the reports and said the Damaturu substation had been long overdue since 2006, after a local contractor failed to deliver the project in a period of 18 months as agreed. The project suffered delays and variations until the present TCN management took over the project.

It is estimated to greatly improve the quantity and quality of electricity supply to about six communities in Yobe State. Additionally, the TCN stated that prior to the completion of the new transmission substation, electricity voltage to Damaturu and its environs was poor due to very long 33kV distribution line from the Potiskum 132kV substation. “As a result, the distribution infrastructure from Potiskum was unable to guarantee four hours of electricity daily to the area. The narrative will, however, change with the new 330/132/33kV Damaturu transmission substation,” said Mrs Ndibi. The transmission firm also stated that several projects were currently ongoing in its network nationwide. It has also resolved to continue to pursue and implement the incremental power policy of the Federal Government by investing in capacity expansion initiatives through its Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Programme.
