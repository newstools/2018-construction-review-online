Mall of Africa in South Africa is set to debut with the largest rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) system. It will unveil a world first in integrated renewable energy systems of its kind in the southern hemisphere and tenth worldwide. The mall which is located in the heart of Waterfall City, in Johannesburg is owned in a joint venture by Attacq (80%) and Atterbury (20%), and is South Africa’s largest shopping mall ever built in one phase, offering over 130 000 m2 of retail space.

The 4 755 kW installation covers most of the available mall roof space, an area of about 45 000 m² and the energy generated will be used to power the mall’s daily operations. It is estimated to be able to produce 7 800 MWh/y. Solareff and Attacq successfully worked through the lengthy legal process, together with Nersa and Eskom, to ensure full legal compliance for this solution – the first of its size in South Africa.
