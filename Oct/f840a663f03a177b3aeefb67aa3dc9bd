This was confirmed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo during the opening ceremony of the National Energy and Climate Change summit at State House. Osinbajo, who was represented by the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, said the federal government was doing a lot to attract both domestic and foreign direct investment into the energy sector to meet the required investment. “We are convinced that this will help us to create more jobs, create additional wealth and reduced poverty in our country. We would like foreign investors to work with local investors and professionals in line with the Presidential Executive Order No.5,” Osinbajo said.
