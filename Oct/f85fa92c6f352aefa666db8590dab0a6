The US $9.5m Trekkopje solar project in Namibia, funded by its construction from the Bank Windhoek in conjunction with the Enertronica Group in now operational. The solar project which was constructed by the Enertronica Group, a multinational industrial company specialising in renewable energy is part of the development of solar parks in the country.

This is the first plant where Enertronica Group’s patented trackers are mounted on the structure which means that the modules will follow the sun during the day, optimising the already high irradiation,” said Dr Maurizio Decinti, lead consultant to the project. Optimising renewable energy opportunities is critical for the development of Namibia and together with partnerships such as this one, a great impact can be made and prove that things can be done in cleaner and environmentally friendly ways. Enertronica is a small multinational company present in the main markets where the renewable energy sector is growing. All this without forgetting Italy, where the ambition is to operate in the new frontier of energy saving and distributed energy production.
