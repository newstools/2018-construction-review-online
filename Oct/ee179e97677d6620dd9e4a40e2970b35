The Ugandan cabinet has authorized US $150m loan from the International Development Association (IDA), a member of the World Bank Group, for the construction of safe water sources in more than 20 districts, municipalities, town councils and refuge hosting areas across the country. According to Minister of ICT and National Guidance Mr. Frank Tumwebaze, many of these of areas have had problems with access to safe and clean water. This project will help in addressing the gaps and strengthening the national water and monitoring system. “The Cabinet approved the proposal to borrow up to US $251m from IDA for financing integrated water development management project,” said the Minister.
