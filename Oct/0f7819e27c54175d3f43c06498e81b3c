They said that the wall of the dam is however completed and only minor jobs are remaining, as well as the rehabilitation of the environment around the dam before handing it over to the government very soon. He added and said that the dam already has the capacity to hold water. Construction will cost a whopping US $403m and will support a 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) irrigation scheme nearby and is expected to employ around 800 people, and over 1 000 during harvest time; this is according to the ministry. Construction started in 2013 and was initially expected to finish in 2017 but delayed due to a court case and labour unrest. Once completed, it will be the largest dam in Namibia, almost three times the capacity of the Hardap Dam upstream. The mega dam is a curved gravity dam on the Fish River near Berseba, c. 40 kilometres (25 mi) northwest of the regional capital Keetmanshoop.
