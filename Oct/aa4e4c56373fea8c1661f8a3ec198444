Kenya has set aside US $9.9m to construct three modern markets in Kisumu county mainly Jubilee, Kibuye and Otonglo markets in bid to accommodate more traders and end hawkers problem in the city. The Kisumu construction project will also end fire outbreaks attributed to electric faults due to poor or illegal connections. More than 10,000 hawkers operate within undesignated streets, causing disorder in the city. Traders complain about unfair competition. With licensed traders paying land rates, electricity bills, paying workers and other county charges, Ombara said it was time to have everybody at designated trading areas so as to avoid conflicts.
