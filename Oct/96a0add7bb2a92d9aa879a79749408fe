When the President of the African Sovereign State of Rwanda wanted to secure his Aircraft Hanger at Kigali Airport, they came to EDSUK to help find a solution. The aircraft hanger was built some years previously but was manually operated as opposed to automatic, which took upwards of six men to manually open and close the 15 meter high, 90 meter wide eight sixteen panel doors and had the obviously Health & Safety Risks. Following a world wide search the Rwanda Airports Company Ltd had several organisations that came and looked at the project, but turned it down due the complexities and challenges involved. As we like a challenge at EDSUK and given we are International Automation, Security and Engineering specialists, with a forte in dealing with bespoke and complicated projects, we took on the project and flew a team of engineers out from the UK to visit Kigali Airport in Rwanda and carry out a full site survey to help us understand the exact nature of the project, this then enabled our engineers to create a full 3d mock up of the Aircraft Hanger Doors and adapt them to facilitated the automation, which required a great deal of design time to create the perfect solution for the clients needs, from both a security and practicality perspective. The large scale automation system we are manufacturing is completely British manufactured from our factory in Birmingham West Midlands UK and as such, comes with the highest level of quality and the UKâ€™s finest minds working to develop a solution that is not only fit for purpose, but also completely safe and regulated. Our team of specialist engineers have been working tirelessly to develop a solution that completely fits the need of our client, and will be shortly flying out to Africa to finally implement the fruits of our labours. All of us at EDS are extremely excited to be involved in such a pivotal project for the development of Kigali International airport, and the region. From initial enquiry, through the quoting process, design process and beyond, our team have worked tirelessly to provide a prestige level of service from 6,200 + Miles away, and ensure a strong working relationship between EDS and client, in order to make the project run as smoothly as possible. Overall, the process from start to finish has been an amazing project to develop and be a part of, and we hope to work with more organisations like Kigali Airport, in order to drive their operations into the future!
