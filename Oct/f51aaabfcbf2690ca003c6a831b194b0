We have also finished work on this Eleganza Roundabout and we are linking the rigid pavement to connecting roads.

“Section four is the longest of about 650 m and it has cured completely, all other portions have cured except this roundabout area,” the report added. The 4 km dual carriageway which is being funded by AG Dangote Construction Company Ltd, the Nigerian Ports Authority and Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc and built with cement, has a median, walkways and side barriers on the various sections painted in black and white. Big drainage on both sides has also been completed while street lights have also been erected on Sections one and four of the project. The interlocking stones are still being laid on about three-quarter of the service lane of outbound Apapa dual carriageway. Section one of the project is 520m, section two is 450m, three is 380 while section four is 650m. “We are screeding and painting the median barriers and sidewalks at the same time. Screeding is like applying POP or dressing on a surface to make it smooth for painting.
“This project would have been completed but we did not expect the amount of rainfall that came in this month of September,” explained the reports.
