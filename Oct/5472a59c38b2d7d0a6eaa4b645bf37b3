The government of Ghana has invested US $5.9m for the construction and completion works on ten hospitals throughout the country following death cases caused by lack of near hospitals. As it stands, one of the ten hospitals is functioning. The Ga North Municipal Hospital in the Greater Accra region is the first to finish completion earlier this month. Although not fully-operational, the GHS has gathered over a dozen staff members who operate the outpatient center from 8am to 4pm. “It’s good news that this hospital is up and running, but hospitals are not just buildings. When you construct a hospital, you have to make sure that it comes with all the proper equipment and facilities.“We had to get doctors within the region and we got a few staff to go there and get the hospital running,” said Anthony Nsiah-Asare, the head of Ghana Health Service (GHS).

However the government is working with directors of health in each region to get them functioning and to fast track work abandoned in the health facilities in the region.Upon completion the hospitals will operate 24 hours a day.
