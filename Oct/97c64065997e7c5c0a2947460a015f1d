An investment of at least US $2.3bn is required in the next five years to fix Zimbabwe’s water and sewer system and replace old sewer pipes. George Makunde, Local Government Investment Conference (Logic) Chairperson and Chitungwiza town clerk said that in order for the waste water and solid waste to come to a manageable level, the investment will have to be made. “An investment strategy that attracts both local and foreign direct investment (FDI) is highly needed,” he said. “Lack of affordable housing, attractive competitive rates for new investors in the real estate, lack of jobs, health services and reliable clean water and sanitation are some of the key development challenges the local authorities face,” Mr Makunde added. He further stated that each local authority will need varied financial requirement based on the scale and size of the population it serves. He acknowledged that Harare is a major city that has grown without the adequate essential facilities but, regionalism can correct that.
