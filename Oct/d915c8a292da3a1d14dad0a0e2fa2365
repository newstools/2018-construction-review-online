Owing to the power rationing Uganda endured between 2005 and 2011, the government has, over the years, been promoting investment in power generation plants. As a result, installed power capacity has increased from 180MW in the mid-90s to 932MW, according to the Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA). Moreover, an additional 783MW will be supplied to the national grid raising it to 1,715MW after the commissioning of Karuma and Isimba dams, next year. The goal of the government is to have adequate and reliable power supply. It also wants low retail tariffs to encourage consumption. To ensure that the power generated is consumed, the government wants it wheeled from the generation points to distributors’ utilities on to the users. The government however ruled out borrowing money for engineering, procurement and construction work in the distribution segment.
