The National Buildings Inspectorate (NBI) in Kenya has declared 240 houses in Athi River’s Everest Park Apartments phase I, unfit for occupation. The firm cited shoddy construction work which  make the houses dangerous for human habitation. More than 200 middle class home buyers are facing huge losses after the decision was made. The project which was launched in 2012 is worth a whopping US $9m and is a joint venture between Everest Park Limited, the developer, and Shelter Afrique as the equity financier.

The building’s window frames on the canopy are also deflated and the window panels  broken. Moreover, dampness was also seen on the wall foundation, and surface of the walls appeared rough, flaky and pity. This can however be rectified by strengthening the foundation. Delays in compliance can squarely be blamed on residents and developers. Where there is rapid compliance by residents, demolitions can be achieved real-time as the critical risk is the welfare of residents. Residents are advised to embrace government advice on their safety positively and respond positively and in haste for their own sakes. The National Building Inspectorate audits buildings for conformity with land registration, planning, zoning, building standards and structural soundness. On the other hand, The National Construction Authority (NCA) regulates construction sites, as well as contractors and their labour, while improving their skills.
