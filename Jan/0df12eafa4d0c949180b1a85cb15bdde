Three Kenyan public universities are set to develop new hostels by the help of the National Treasury which is targeting to raise approximately US$ 200m for the project. This initiative will hopefully host an extra 30,000 new beds. The targeted public universities include: Embu University College, South Eastern Kenya University (SEKU) and Moi University through public-private partnerships (PPPs).

However the total number has now been raised to 30,000. Additionally, the treasury through a statement explained that it will soon hold an investor conference at InterContinental Hotel, Nairobi, with potential bidders to fund the new project in the universities. “The Public Private Partnership Unit, under the National Treasury, will hold an investor conference on the development of hostels for public universities in a bid to boost bed capacity,” said the statement. Several institutions of Higher learning are experiencing a scarcity of hostels and bed space due to an increase in student enrollment in the institutions. It is further understood that most schools have sought the Treasury’s approval to use PPPs to finance hostels to house 60,000 beds, among them being JKUAT, Maseno, Egerton and the Kenya school of Government. Potential investors, the PPPU and the vice-chancellors of the universities are expected to attend the upcoming meeting in order to help raise funds and also brainstorm on the way forward.
