The Management of the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) has disclosed plans to reduce the cost of operations which have been causing a great loss to the entity. LEC Chief Executive Officer John Ashley is confident that with reduction in the cost of operations, the entity will immensely drive towards a more meaningful success. According to Ashley, the decision to reduce its operational cost is based on the increase in power-thief that is causing a decrease in revenue generation for effective operations of the corporation. Ashley also disclosed that LEC is incurring losses of US $16m annually as a result of power theft. He said management is not ready to reduce tariff now considering the increase in power theft, thus putting the corporation at a loss. Ashley further added that the entity is obligated to the West African Power Pool (WAPO) in the sum of US $300,000; as such, it needs to generate more resources to settle its obligations. The WAPO electricity is already in use in Maryland, Nimba and Grand Gedeh Counties. This is part of the West African power supply agreement between member countries of the Economic Community of West African State (ECOWAS) and whose supply is through the Ivory Coast.
