Nyor Diaplay is the biggest town in the Nyor Clan in Buu-Yao Administrative District, Nimba County electoral district and is close to the border with the Ivory Coast. The new facility will eventually bring relief not only to the people of the county but also to every Liberian citizen in that they will not be forced to go to neighboring cities for treatment. It will also have state-of-the-art equipment and professional health workers and doctors. In 2016, authorities of Nimba County dedicated another health facility named the E&J Medical Center in District #1, Nimba County. It took three years to complete the US $2m facility. It joined the Jackson F. Doe in Tappita and Ganta United Methodist Hospital in Ganta as the three leading facilities in Nimba County. The Chinese-built Jackson F. Doe Hospital was opened in 2011, while the Ganta UMH was constructed in 1926 by an American Missionary Dr. George Way Harley.
