The construction of the much awaited Kidunda Dam water project in Morogoro Region Tanzania will take off in July 2018. The dam, which is targeting to improve water supply in Dar es Salaam and Coast regions is dependent on the materialization of ongoing funding negotiations. The negotiations are between the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) and the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). DAWASA Acting Chief Executive Officer, Engineer Romanus Mwang’ingo, said the authority was in talks with NSSF to seal a deal. Terms of the deal will have DAWASA finance the US $215m project. DAWASA has already dished out US $3.15m as compensation. The funds will benefit over 2,000 residents in eight villages in Morogoro Rural District. They will also serve as a means to pave the way for construction of Kidunda Dam.
