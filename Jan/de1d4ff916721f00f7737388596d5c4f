The bypass project is expected to open up the North Rift region for more business opportunities and solidify Eldoret Town as the capital investment hub in the region. Mr Mandago also cautioned the small scale traders who have set up temporary structures on the road reserves saying that they will be evicted. “Proper notice was given to them and we hope that they comply or they will be forcefully evicted,” he said. The road project was launched by President Kenyatta last year.
