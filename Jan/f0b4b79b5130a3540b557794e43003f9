They achieved operating profitability in the largest market, launched a transformative new phase of product and technology development, and also established clear market leadership in four African markets. The company currently provides power to more than 150,000 homes and businesses across Tanzania, Rwanda, Côte d’Ivoire, and Ghana. Off Grid Electric and EDF first partnered for a joint venture in Côte d’Ivoire in November 2016. Building on their success in Côte d’Ivoire, where the company already has over 10,000 customers, the pair is expanding their partnership to Ghana. Both companies will operate and also share financial risks. The Ghanaian company CH Group will join Off Grid Electric and EDF, and further hold a 20% share in the partnership. The sale of 10,000 off-grid kits in Côte d’Ivoire within the space of just a few months is living proof of the appeal and efficiency offered by off-grid solutions. According to Marianne Laigneau, group senior executive Vice-President at ED, Off-grid power is becoming a strong contributor to the expansion of business and fits perfectly into their CAP2030 strategy, which aims to triple the EDF Group’s international business outside of Europe by year 2030.
