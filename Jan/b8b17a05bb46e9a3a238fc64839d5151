Reports from the Nigeria power sector through the federal government indicate that the country has approximately 2000MW of unutilized electricity. According to the government, the electricity will benefit manufacturing bases across Nigeria if properly utilized. However, the report goes on to add that the energy remains unutilized because of lack of interest from manufacturers. The Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola explained that power generation and transmission capacities of the country had grown to 7,000MW. However, distribution had only inched up to 5,000MW. This leaves 2,000MW unused.

The minister equally claimed that Nigerians are now spending less money on fuel and diesel for their private generators. He noted that reports he gathered also proved that Nigerians were equally being conscious of their power consumption. Fashola, also commissioned a 60MVA transformer installed by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to boost electricity supply to Keffi and its environs in Nasarawa. The transformer, according to the Interim Managing Director of TCN, Mr. Usman Mohammed, was installed with support from the World Bank under the Nigeria Electricity and Gas Improvement Project (NEGIP). Mohammed also stated that this was through the government’s Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Program (TREP). TREP will stabilize, expand and provide the needed flexibility to Discos to effectively supply their customers.
