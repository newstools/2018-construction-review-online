Expansion of the Kimara-Kiluvya, a section of Morogoro road in Tanzania is expected to start any time in February this year. The project comes after a successful demolition of structures, which were erected on the road reserve. The construction is meant to expand the highway to six lanes on the 16-km stretch between Kiluvya and the Bus Rapid Transit Terminal at Kimara from the current two lanes; the Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads) has said. “The main goal is to reduce traffic jams on this road which serves more than 35,000 cars out of which 40% are trucks, which convey goods from Port of Dar es Salaam to landlocked countries,” the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication Mr Joseph Nyamhanga said. Speaking during a tour of the project site in Dar es Salaam, Mr. Nyamhanga said the government has already allocated US $17m for the project and it is only waiting for the signing of a contract with Tanroads before it hands over the money to the latter. “We will hand over the money to Tanroads after seeing their procurement document that shows the amount needed in the project. The funds for the project, will be sourced by the government 100%,” he said.

Meanwhile, the procurement and design processes will be completed in February this year but in the very same month, Tanroads will be continuing with the construction of divergent lanes/service roads that will be used by vehicles when actual construction starts. So far, the service road from Kimara to Kongoro (5.2km) has been completed while construction for Korongo to Kibamba (6.5km) and Kibamba to Kiluvya sections are ongoing. The construction will take at least 36 months.
