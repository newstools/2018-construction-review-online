The mega project is among President Uhuru’s “Big Four” policy agendas that he intends to fulfill together with his team before his term expires. The Principal Secretary for Housing and Urban Development Aidah Munano confirmed the reports and said that the ministry was working on an incentive package to attract international developers into the project that targets up to a million low-cost housing units by 2022.
