A US$ 14m dispute has interfered with the construction of the mega Tatu City development project leading to a temporary halt. The dispute engulfed between the contractors- Ongata Works and Tatu City Ltd. The High Court gave orders and directed Ongata Works to execute a bond of US $1.4m as a condition for granting the injunction. The contractor and the developer differed after Tatu City ordered Ongata Works to leave the site within 14 days, citing failure by the contractor to comply with certain instructions. However, the contractor went to court and obtained orders restraining the developer from evicting them and taking over the site pending the hearing of the case. Further to this, Ongata Works accused Tatu City of frustrating and obstructing their work and changing instructions along the way leading to delays in completion. The construction works have since been stopped pending the court’s determination.
