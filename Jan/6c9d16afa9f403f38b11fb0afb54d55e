The opening of the New Abuja Airport Terminal in Nigeria is likely to be delayed despite the tremendous work already done at the new terminal of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport. While inspecting the facility, the Minister of State for Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika said one of the causes of the delay is a foundational issue which had altered the master plan of the airport. According to him, the planning of the project did not envisage that the building will lead to additional works, power and water supply. He said that it was also discovered that the building will block both the control and fire towers which would require relocation, so additional work is required to link it with the existing terminal as well as expanding the apron to accommodate bigger air planes.

Unfortunately, some of these components are complex which would delay this job and some of them are from the foundation like that of the sewer and water. There is also the problem of the control tower blocking the access into the terminal apron and also the inadequate nature of the apron itself,” said Sirika.
