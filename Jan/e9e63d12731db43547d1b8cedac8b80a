The move is a link target that their neighboring state had started four years back. Mr. Zimbe stated that the concrete power transmission lines have the ability to endure fire outbreaks. They are also relatively cheaper compared to the wooden ones. Furthermore, concrete poles are durable, a quality that makes them the perfect fit for the long run. In the meantime, there have been reports of illegal connectivity of power supply. However, many people tend to opt for such in the line of cheaper alternative that override the general aspect of security. The Managing Director has clearly said they will educate the public on the demerits of such activities and make necessary enforcement. Such actions will ensure minimized electricity theft. As such, the company can concentrate on offering better services, as they keenly look to add more revenues under their belt.
