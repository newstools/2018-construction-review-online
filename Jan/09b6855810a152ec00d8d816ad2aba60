A US$ 97m complex that is being constructed by a Chinese State-owned manufacturing and real estate firm AVIC International is set to be Kenya’s largest commercial consumer of electricity. The 43-storey complex in Nairobi’s Westlands area will overtake Two Rivers Mall as Kenya’s current largest commercial consumer of electricity. It will use more power than the combined demand for Two Rivers and Garden City malls in Nairobi.

According to Kenya Power records, at 12 MVA, the demand is twice Two Rivers mall’s and four times that of Garden City mall. Currently, Two Rivers is the single largest electricity consumer, outside factories, after opening its doors last year in February. It is also the largest shopping complex in East Africa. The AVIC mega-complex in Westlands sits next to Villa Rosa Kempinski Hotel and will comprise an office block, a hotel tower and four apartment blocks, offering a glimpse into its expected power needs. The AVIC International Africa Headquarters is a development being built in Nairobi’s Westlands district. The complex will be the hub of AVIC International’s African operations and the tallest tower in the scheme will stand at 178m.
