The Federal Government of Nigeria has plans to terminate the contract for the remodeling of the domestic wing of the Port Harcourt International Airport in Rivers State. Minister of State for Aviation, Hadi Sirika, during an inspection of the airport, said government has had enough of the incomplete project, and will take a legal means to fix the problem. The Guide to Sleeping in Airports 2017, survey rated the Port Harcourt airport as one of the worst aerodromes in the world, citing its rather unwelcoming ambience and officials’ extortion with impunity.

Since then, he has taken his own speed the way he deems fit, and he has been indulged. He even changed the scope of work without approval, and subsequently went to the previous government and got approval to that effect. When we came in, we had no option than to continue since he had a legitimate extension and expansion approval from the then government,” he said. The minister noted that Port Harcourt is very important to the Nigerian economy; hence government is very keen on completing the project due to the current hardship being faced by travelers.
