John Deere has announced the new 204L and 304L compact wheel loaders, which are specifically designed to increase uptime and deliver higher productivity to customers. These models are built for professionals who frequently work in small spaces and on rough terrain. The 204L packs 62 horsepower, while the 304L delivers 67 horsepower while in use. Both models are equipped with Final Tier 4 Yanmar engines, and they have hydrostatic transmissions that keep noise to a minimum. Operators can also opt for ride control, which can reduce material spillage and create a smoother ride over uneven terrain. “We’re packing more productivity and efficiency into the wheel loader with the release of our L-Series models,” said Drew Miller, product marketing manager of compact wheel loaders with John Deere Construction & Forestry. “Perfect for year-round use, these workhorses were designed to take on tough jobs from warmer summer months to snowy winter conditions, while enabling the use of a versatile attachments portfolio when you need them.” The wheel loaders also have self-adjusting park and service brakes, as well as ground-level maintenance points for easy access. They include extended service intervals for engine oil/filter, final drives oil and hydraulic oil as well. Operators can opt for an enclosed cab or an open station with these loaders, both of which provide 360-degree visibility.
