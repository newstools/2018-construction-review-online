A US $25m hotel is set to be constructed in Blantyre, Malawi by a Chinese investor. The investor will construct a mega business park that will encompass the hotel which is aimed at attracting conferences and other businesses. Xia Fang, vice-president of Anhui Foreign Economic Construction (Group) Co, confirmed the reports and said that the project is scheduled for completion in December 2018. He further said that it will make Blantyre which is the commercial capital of Malawi a bigger year-round attraction for conference tourism, commercial business and family entertainment. The new initiative dubbed Sogecoa Business Park will include a five-star hotel, a recreation center with a casino and a shopping mall and cinema; this will revive the city as a regional trade hub. Furthermore, the Chinese company plans to invest a whopping US $75m in another business park and a shopping center in Lilongwe, the country’s capital. “Malawi is a true friend of China and has for the past 10 years offered us a good environment to invest. We are ready to invest more in this peaceful country, known as the Warm Heart of Africa,” says Xia. This year marks the 10th anniversary of relations between Malawi and China. The development achievements between the two countries over these 10 years are visible for all to see. Among the achievements of China-Malawi cooperation are the construction of the Malawi Parliament building, Bingu National Stadium, Karonga-Chitipa Road in the northern region, the Bingu Conference Center and Hotel, Malawi University of Science and Technology and the presidential villas.
