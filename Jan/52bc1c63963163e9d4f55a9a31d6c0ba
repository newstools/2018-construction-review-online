Reconstruction work on the soweto bridge over Klipspruit river, in Soweto has kicked off. The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) commenced the upgrading work owing to overtopping during heavy rainfall. “The bridge in Klipspruit West is known to bring traffic to a halt during heavy downpours, rendering it unsafe for pedestrians due to the increased water levels on low lying areas of the structure,” said JRA in a statement on Friday. The 12-month reconstruction of the vehicular and pedestrian bridge began on January 8 and is expected to be completed in early January 2019. As part of the construction process, Bridge road will be closed to the public throughout the construction period, from January 1 to December 31. However, a traffic management plan has been put in place and motorists are advised to consider alternative routes during the construction period. Access will be limited to property owners and pedestrians. Temporary warning signs have been installed and the road will be barricaded off and traffic will be redirected via the Main road. Property owners who will be allowed access are required to travel at a safe distance upon entry into the construction area, travel at reduced speeds, be aware of construction workers on site and adhere to traffic guidelines, flag people and signage.
