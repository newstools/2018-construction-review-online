Following the agreement, solar power farms will be in some federal universities across the country. Schlagheck noted that for many years Germany has been one of the major donors to climate protection action in developing and new industrializing countries, adding that in recent years the German government has systematically stepped up its climate commitments in the developing world. Germany has pledged and contributed roughly US $1bn to the Green Climate Fund. From this, developing countries (including Nigeria) can benefit in the fight against climate change. The Ambassador also decried that climate change has become one of the greatest challenges facing mankind today. He assured that the German government will continue to increase its investments in international climate protection. He also stressed the need for countries in Africa to accelerate action on issues concerning climate change.
